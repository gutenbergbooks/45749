<h2 class="p4">"ANTHONY HOPE."</h2>


<p class="pn p2">In his speech at the annual banquet of the
Royal Academy in 1894, among many other good
things, Mr. Andrew Lang said:</p>

<p>"The thrifty plan of giving us sermons, politics,
fiction, all in one stodgy sandwich, produces
no permanent literature, produces but temporary
'tracts for the times.' Fortunately we
have among us many novelists&mdash;young ones,
luckily&mdash;who are true to the primitive and
eternal, the Fijian canons of fiction. We have
Oriental romance from the author of 'Plain
Tales from the Hills.' We have the humor and
tenderness&mdash;certainly not Fijian, I admit&mdash;which
produces that masterpiece 'A Window
in Thrums'; we have the adventurous fancy that
gives us 'A Gentleman of France,' 'The
Master of Ballantrae,' 'Micah Clarke,' 'The
Raiders,' 'The Prisoner of Zenda.'"</p>

<p>The last of these books was by Anthony
Hope Hawkins, whom Mr. Lang thus classed
among potential immortals. This romance
has made him within the last three months
fairly famous. Walter Besant, too, has stamped
it with his high approval, and the English
and American press have been unusually
unanimous in their praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Its hero is a rare and striking figure, and
thoroughly represents the ideal soldier of our
Anglo-Saxon race. He faces great dangers
and does brave deeds, quietly and quickly. He
suffers and loves deeply, but says little. In his
portrayal, the possibilities of "repressed emotion"
have been startlingly indicated. He appeals
to Americans and English far more than
the swaggering and loquacious, though more
historic heroes of Dumas and his school ever
can.</p>

<p>Much curiosity has been excited regarding
"Anthony Hope."</p>

<p>The author's methods of composition and what
may have suggested the very original plot are as
yet unknown. Besides what we may get from
his portrait, we are told that he is "a tall, thin,
dark man, with a face that would be ascetic if
it were not bubbling with humor." He is a
lawyer, as other good romancers have been before
him, and has chambers in the Middle
Temple, a place made famous in fiction by
Thackeray and on the stage by Pinero. His
profession and politics are his chief concerns,
and literature a diversion in his leisure hours.
He is an extremely modest man, and in response
to a request from his American publishers
for autobiographical matter, gave the barest
facts of his life. He expressed absolutely no
opinion on literary canons or on his own work.
There was, however, a rare sincerity and cordiality
in his letters.</p>

<p>Anthony Hope Hawkins was born in 1863,
his father being the Rev. E. C. Hawkins of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Brides, Fleet Street, London. He was educated
at Marlborough, and at Balliol College, Oxford,
of which he was a scholar. At Oxford, he was
a hard worker and obtained first classes in
Classical Moderations and in the School of
Litteræ Humaniores, commonly known as
"Greats." At this university, where he attained
the degree of M. A. some eight years ago, he
began to show an aptitude for public life, was a
striking figure among his contemporaries, and
became president of the Union. In 1892 he
stood as a Liberal candidate for a seat in Parliament
from the southern division of Buckinghamshire,
but was defeated by Viscount Curzon.</p>

<p>His first book, "A Man of Mark," was published
in 1890, and was followed next year by
"Father Stafford," an interesting study of an
Anglican priest's struggles between love and
sense of obligation to his vow of celibacy.
The pictures of his cheerless ascetic life are
marked by the sincerity conspicuous in Mr.
Hawkins' later books. Some very thoughtful
conversations on art and on religion are introduced.</p>

<p>In 1892 appeared "Mr. Witt's Widow, a
Frivolous Tale" of a lady who had "harmonious
contrasts," such as dark eyes and golden hair.
It foreshadows the power in plot-making that
characterizes our author's later works.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1893 appeared "Sport Royal,"
a collection of Mr. Hawkins' short stories,
mostly from the <i>St. James' Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>In "Half a Hero," published last year, there
are several foreshadowings of "The Prisoner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Zenda." In both stories the scene is imaginary,
but given realism by characteristics respectively
of New Zealand and of Germany; in both
intrigues and heroism are conspicuous, though
in the latter the author did not adopt the old
device of giving his hero some bad qualities to
make him human. "Half a Hero" contains
much firm, crisp character-drawing, and a strong
love interest, but has the slight taint of the
"purpose novel," already noted in Father Stafford;
in this case, the discussion being politics,
especially the "labor" element.</p>

<p>Anthony Hope inherited refinement through
a father in an exalted calling; he used his
college advantages to the utmost, and now his
interests are in living public affairs, and in his
chosen calling as a lawyer, he has good opportunities
to study life, and seems already to have
well mastered the best elements of Anglo-Saxon
character. From his work, he appears
to have read widely and with a sympathetic eye
for the merits of markedly diverse writers,
which he seems to make his own. His style
has the terseness and suggestiveness characteristic
of Kipling, but without his harshness, and
at times he shows a sense of beauty almost
worthy of our own Hawthorne, and withal the
military dash and snap of Lever. It would be
strange if the foundation for the remarkably
life-like colonists of "Half a Hero," and the German
officers of "The Prisoner of Zenda," had
had not been laid by travel and the observation
of their more or less remote prototypes.</p>

<p>"A Change of Air," while containing much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
of its humor and snap, furnishes a marked contrast
to "The Prisoner of Zenda," and is in a
more serious vein, having a strong and tragic
undercurrent, and not without an element of
peril. Confining its occurrences pretty severely
to the possible and generally probable, it nevertheless
is highly original. Dale Bannister, the
wild young poet, who commences by thoroughly
scandalizing Market Denborough, is a most
picturesque and uncommon character. The
effect of his early principles on his later life is
deftly indicated. The story moves on steadily,
and while it teaches a lesson of moderation and
charity, it does so entirely by the acts and
thoughts of the characters without any sermonizing
on the part of the author. Some good
authorities that have seen this book place it
even above "The Prisoner of Zenda," which we
probably shall see on the stage next year, as
the author has a friend busily engaged on its
dramatization.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Mission to the Heathen.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">When the Great King, that mirror of a
majesty whereof modern times have
robbed the world, recoiled aghast
from the threatened indignity of having
to wait, he laid his finger with a true touch
on a characteristic incident of the lot of common
men, from which it was seemly that the state of
God's Vicegerents should be free. It was a
small matter, no doubt, a thing of manners
merely, and etiquette; yet manners and etiquette
are first the shadowed expression of facts and
then the survival of them; the reverence once
paid to power, and now accorded, in a strange
mixture of chivalry and calculation, to mere
place whence power has fled. The day of
vicegerents is gone, and the day of officers has
come; and it is not unknown that officers
should have to wait, or even&mdash;such is the insolence,
no longer of office, but of those who give
it&mdash;should altogether go without. Yet, although
everybody has now to wait, everybody has not
to wait the same length of time. For example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
a genius needs not wait so long for what he
wants as a fool&mdash;unless, as chances now and
then, he be both a genius and a fool, when
probably his waiting will be utterly without
end.</p>

<p>In a small flat in Chelsea, very high toward
heaven, there sat one evening in the summer,
two young men and a genius; and the younger
of the young men, whose name was Arthur
Angell, said discontentedly to the genius:</p>

<p>"The brute only sent me ten and sixpence.
What did you get for yours?"</p>

<p>The genius blushed and murmured apologetically:</p>

<p>"That agent chap I've sold myself to got
twenty pounds for it."</p>

<p>The second young man, who was not so
young, being, in fact, well turned of thirty, and
growing bald, took his pipe out of his mouth,
and, pointing the stem first at the genius, then
at Arthur Angell, and lastly, like a knife, at his
own breast, said:</p>

<p>"Pounds&mdash;shillings&mdash;and pence. He sent
me nothing at all."</p>

<p>A pause followed, and the genius began:</p>

<p>"Look here, you fellows&mdash;&mdash;" But Philip
Hume went on: "Ten and sixpence is a good
sum of money, a comfortable sum of money,
and, my dear Arthur, I should say the full value
of your poem. As to Dale's poem, who knows
the value of Dale's poem? By what rod shall
you measure&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off with a laugh
at Dale's gesture of protest.</p>

<p>"I'm making the deuce of a lot of money,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
said Dale in an awestruck tone. "It's rolling
in. I don't know what to do with it."</p>

<p>"Littlehill will swallow it," said Philip.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that he sticks to that
idea?" exclaimed Arthur. "You don't, do
you, Dale?"</p>

<p>"I do," answered Dale. "I'm not going
permanently. I'm not going to forsake our old
ways or our old life. I'm not going to turn
into a rich man."</p>

<p>"I hope not, by Jove!" cried Arthur.</p>

<p>"But I want to see the country&mdash;I've not
seen it for years. And I want to see country
people, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It'll end in our losing you," prophesied
Arthur gloomily.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Dale, flushing a little.
"It'll end in nothing of the sort. I've only
taken the house for a year."</p>

<p>"A gentleman's residence," said Philip;
"five sitting rooms, twelve bedrooms, offices,
stabling, and three acres of grounds."</p>

<p>Arthur groaned.</p>

<p>"It sounds a villa all over," he said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Dale sharply; "it's a
country house."</p>

<p>"Is there any difference?" asked Arthur
scornfully.</p>

<p>"All the difference," said Philip; "as you
would know if you moved in anything approaching
respectable circles."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I don't," said Arthur. "What
will respectable circles say to 'The Clarion,'
eh, Dale?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who cares what they say?" laughed Dale.
"They seem to buy it."</p>

<p>Arthur looked at him with revengeful eye,
and suddenly inquired.</p>

<p>"What about Nellie?"</p>

<p>"That's just the delightful part of it,"
answered Dale eagerly. "Nellie's been seedy
ever so long, you know. She was ordered perfect
rest and country air. But it didn't run
to it."</p>

<p>"It never ran to anything here," said Philip
in a tone of dispassionate acquiescence in facts,
"till you became famous."</p>

<p>"Now I can help!" pursued Dale. "She
and Mrs. Hodge are coming to pay me a long
visit. Of course, Phil's going to be there permanently.
You'll come too, Arthur?"</p>

<p>At first Arthur Angell said he would not go
near a villa; he could not breath in a villa; or
sleep quiet o' nights in a villa; but presently he
relented.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it for long, though," he said.
"Still, I'm glad you're going to have Nellie
there. She'd have missed you awfully. When
do you go?"</p>

<p>"Actually, to-morrow. I'm not used to it
yet."</p>

<p>Arthur shook his head again, as he put on
his hat.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night," said he. "I hope it's
all right."</p>

<p>Dale waited till the door was closed behind
his guest, and then laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"I like old Arthur," he said. "He's so keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and in earnest about it. But it's all bosh.
What difference can it make whether I live in
London or the country? And it's only for a
little while."</p>

<p>"He begins to include you in the well-to-do
classes, and suspects you accordingly," replied
Philip.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and a pretty
girl came in.</p>

<p>"Oh, I ran up," she said, "to ask whether
this hat would do for Denshire. I don't want
to disgrace you, Dale;" and she held up a hat
she carried in her hand.</p>

<p>"It would do for Paradise," said Dale. "Besides,
there isn't going to be any difference at
all in Denshire. We are going to be and do
and dress just as we are and do and dress here.
Aren't we, Phil?"</p>

<p>"That is the scheme," said Philip.</p>

<p>"We shall care for no one's opinion," pursued
Dale, warming to his subject. "We shall
be absolutely independent. We shall show
them that their way of living is not the only way
of living. We&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In fact, Nellie," interrupted Philip, "we
shall open their eyes considerably. So we flatter
ourselves."</p>

<p>"It's not that at all," protested Dale.</p>

<p>"You can't help it, Dale," said Nellie, smiling
brightly at him. "Of course they will open
their eyes at the great Mr. Bannister. We all
open our eyes at him, don't we, Mr. Hume?
Well, then, the hat will do&mdash;as a week-day hat,
I mean?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"A week-day hat?" repeated Philip. "Dear
old phrase! It recalls one's happy church-going
youth. Have you also provided a Sunday
hat?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Hume."</p>

<p>"And, Dale, have you a Sunday coat?"</p>

<p>Dale laughed.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty excuse for pretty things, Phil,"
he said. "Let Nellie have her Sunday hat. I
doubt if they'll let me into the church."</p>

<p>Philip stretched out his hand and took up a
glass of whisky and water which stood near
him.</p>

<p>"I drink to the success of the expedition!"
said he.</p>

<p>"To the success of our mission!" cried Dale
gayly, raising his glass. "We will spread the
light!"</p>

<p>"Here's to Dale Bannister, apostle <i>in partibus!</i>"
and Philip drank the toast.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>The New Man at Littlehill.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Market Denborough is not a
large town. Perhaps it is none the
worse for that, and, if it be, there is
compensation to be found in its picturesqueness,
its antiquity, and its dignity; for
there has been a town where it stands from
time immemorial; it makes a great figure in
county histories and local guidebooks; it is an
ancient corporation, an assize town, and quarter-sessions
borough. It does not grow, for
country towns, dependent solely on the support
of the rural districts surrounding, are not given
to growing much nowadays. Moreover, the
Delanes do not readily allow new houses to be
built, and if a man lives in Market Denborough,
he must be a roofless vagrant or a tenant of Mr.
Delane. It is not the place to make a fortune;
but, on the other hand, unusual recklessness is
necessary to the losing of one there. If the
triumphs of life are on a small scale, the struggle
for existence is not very fierce, and a wise man
might do worse than barter the uncertain
chances and precarious joys of a larger stage,
to play a modest, easy, quiet part on the little
boards of Market Denborough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the
lion and the lamb have quite sunk their differences
and lain down together at Market Denborough.
There, as elsewhere, the millennium
tarries, and there are not wanting fierce feuds,
personal, municipal, nay, even, within the wide
limits of Mr. Delane's tolerance, political. If it
were not so, the Mayor would not have been
happy, for the Mayor loved a fight; and Alderman
Johnstone, who was a Radical, would have
felt his days wasted; and the two gentlemen
would not have been, as they continually were,
at loggerheads concerning paving contracts and
kindred subjects. There was no want of interests
in life, if a man were ready to take his
own part and keep a sharp eye on the doings of
his neighbor. Besides, the really great events
of existence happened at Market Denborough
much as they do in London; people were born,
and married, and died; and while that rotation
is unchecked, who can be seriously at a loss for
matter of thought or topic of conversation?</p>

<p>As Mr. James Roberts, member of the Royal
College of Surgeons, a thin young man, with
restless eyes and tight-shut lips, walked down
High Street one hot, sunny afternoon, it never
entered his head that there was not enough to
think about in Market Denborough. Wife and
child, rent, rates and taxes, patients and prescriptions,
the relation between those old
enemies, incomings and outgoings, here was
food enough for any man's meditations.
Enough? Ay, enough and to spare of such distasteful,
insipid, narrow, soul-destroying stuff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Mr., or, to give him the brevet rank all the town
gave him. Dr. Roberts, hated these sordid, imperious
interests that gathered round him and
hemmed him in, shutting out all else&mdash;all dreams
of ambition, all dear, long-harbored schemes,
all burning enthusiasms, even all chance of
seeking deeper knowledge and more commanding
skill. Sadly and impatiently the doctor
shook his head, trying to put his visions on one
side, and nail his mind down to its work. His
first task was to turn three hundred pounds a
year into six hundred pounds. It was hard it
should be so, and he chafed against necessity,
forgetting, as perhaps he pardonably might, that
the need was the price he paid for wife and
child. Yes, it was hard; but so it was. If
only more people would be&mdash;no, but if only
more people who were ill would call in Dr.
Roberts! Then he could keep two horses, and
not have to "pad the hoof," as he phrased it to
himself, about sweltering streets or dusty lanes
all the long afternoon, because his one pony was
tired out with carrying him in the morning to
Dirkham, a village five miles off, where he was
medical officer at a salary of forty pounds by
the year. That was forty, and Ethel had a hundred,
and the profits from his paying patients
(even if you allowed for the medicine consumed
by those who did not pay) were about a hundred
and fifty. But then the bills&mdash;&mdash; Oh, well, he
must go on. The second horse must wait, and
that other dream of his, having an assistant,
that must wait, too. If he had an assistant, he
would have some leisure for research, for reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for studying the political and social questions
where his real and engrossing interest lay.
He could then take his part in the mighty work
of rousing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here his meditations were interrupted. He
had reached, in his progress down the street, a
large plate-glass-windowed shop, the shop of a
chemist, and of no less a man than Mr. James
Hedger, Mayor of Market Denborough. The
member of the lower branch of their common
art was a richer man than he who belonged to
the higher, and when Mr. Hedger was playfully
charged with giving the young Doctor his
medicines cheap, he never denied the accusation.
Anyhow, the two were good friends, and
the Mayor, who was surveying his dominions
from his doorstep, broke in on Dr. Roberts'
train of thought with a cheerful greeting.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the news?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; I've no time for the news. I always
look to you for it, Mr. Mayor."</p>

<p>"It mostly comes round to me, being a center,
like," said the Mayor. "It's natural."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it this time?" asked the
Doctor, calling up a show of interest. He did
not care much for Denborough news.</p>

<p>"Littlehill's let," replied the Mayor.</p>

<p>Littlehill, the subject of Philip Hume's half-ironical
description, was a good house, standing
on rising ground about half a mile outside the
town. It belonged, of course, to Mr. Delane,
and had stood empty for more than a year. A
tenant at Littlehill meant an increase of custom
for the tradespeople, and perchance for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
doctors. Hence the importance of the Mayor's
piece of news.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Roberts. "Who's taken
it?"</p>

<p>"Not much good&mdash;a young man, a bachelor,"
said the Mayor, shaking his head. Bachelors
do not require, or anyhow do not take, many
chemist's drugs. "Still, I hear he's well off,
and p'r'aps he'll have people to stop with
him."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Some name like Bannister. He's from
London."</p>

<p>"What's he coming here for?" asked Roberts,
who, if he had been a well-to-do bachelor,
would not have settled at Market Denborough.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he?" retorted the Mayor,
who had never lived, or thought of living, anywhere
else.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't have thought he'd have
found much to do. He wouldn't come in the
summer for the hunting."</p>

<p>"Hunting? Not he! He's a literary gentleman&mdash;writes
poetry and what not."</p>

<p>"Poetry? Why, it's not Dale Bannister, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that's the name."</p>

<p>"Dale Bannister coming to Littlehill! That
is an honor for the town!"</p>

<p>"An honor? What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's a famous man, Mr. Mayor. All
London's talking of him."</p>

<p>"I never heard his name in my life before,"
said the Mayor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he's a genius. His poems are all the
rage. You'll have to read them now."</p>

<p>"He's having a lot done up there," remarked
the Mayor. "Johnstone's got the job. Mr.
Bannister don't know as much about Johnstone
as some of us."</p>

<p>"How should he?" said Roberts, smiling.</p>

<p>"Johnstone's buildin' 'im a room. It'll
tumble down."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Mr. Mayor, you're prejudiced."</p>

<p>"No man can say that of me, sir. But I
knows&mdash;I know Johnstone, Doctor. That's
where it is!"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope Johnstone's room won't fall
on him. We can't spare Dale Bannister.
Good-day, Mr. Mayor."</p>

<p>"Where are you goin'?"</p>

<p>"To Tom Steadman's."</p>

<p>"Is he bad again?" inquired the Mayor, with
interest.</p>

<p>"Yes. He broke out last week, with the
usual result."</p>

<p>"Broke out? Yes! He had two gallons of
beer and a bottle o' gin off the 'Blue Lion' in
one day, the landlord told me."</p>

<p>"They ought to go to prison for serving
him."</p>

<p>"Well, well, a man drinks or he don't," said
the Mayor tolerantly; "and if he does, he'll
get it some'ow. Good-day, sir."</p>

<p>The Doctor completed his rounds, including
the soothing of Tom Steadman's distempered
imagination, and made his way home in quite
a flutter of excitement. Hidden away in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
study, underneath heavy medical works and
voluminous medical journals, where the eye of
patients could not reach, nor the devastations
of them that tidy disturb, lay the two or three
little volumes which held Dale Bannister's
poems. The Doctor would not have admitted
that the poems were purposely concealed, but
he certainly did not display them ostentatiously,
and he undoubtedly told his wife, with much
decision, that he was sure they would not prove
to her taste. Yet he himself almost worshiped
them; all the untamed revolt, the recklessness
of thought, the scorn of respectability, the scant
regard to what the world called propriety, which
he had nourished in his own heart in his youth,
finding no expression for them, and from which
the binding chains of fate seemed now forever
to restrain his spirit, were in those three slim
volumes. First came "The Clarion and other
Poems," a very small book, published by a very
small firm&mdash;published for the author, though
the Doctor did not know this, and circulated at
the expense of the same; then "Sluggards," from
a larger firm, the source of some few guineas to
Dale Bannister, of hundreds more if he had not
sold his copyright; and lastly, "The Hypocrite's
Heaven," quite a lengthy production, blazoning
the name of the leading house of all the trade,
and bearing in its train a wealth of gold, and
praise, and fame for the author: yes, and of
rebuke, remonstrance, blame, and hands uplifted
in horror at so much vice united to so
much genius. Praise and rebuke alike brought
new bricks to build the pyramid of glory; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
on the top of it, an object of abhorrence and of
worship, stood the young poet, prodigally scattering
songs, which, as one critic of position said
of them, should never have been written, but
being written, could never die. Certainly the
coming of such a man to settle there was an
event for Market Denborough; it was a glorious
chance for the poet's silent, secret disciple.
He would see the man; he might speak with
him; if fortune willed, his name might yet be
known, for no merit of his, but as that of Dale
Bannister's friend.</p>

<p>Women have very often, and the best of
women most often, a provoking sedateness of
mind. Mrs. Roberts had never read the poems.
True, but she had, of course, read about them,
and about their author, and about their certain
immortality; yet she was distinctly more interested
in the tidings of Tom Steadman, a
wretched dipsomaniac, than in the unparalleled
news about Dale Bannister. In her heart she
thought the Doctor a cleverer, as she had no
doubt he was a better, man than the poet, and
the nearest approach she made to grasping the
real significance of the situation was when she
remarked:</p>

<p>"It will be nice for him to find one man, at
all events, who can appreciate him."</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled; he was pleased&mdash;who
would not be?&mdash;that his wife should think first
of the pleasure Dale Bannister would find in
his society. It was absurd, but it was charming
of her, and as she sat on the edge of his
chair, he put his arm round his waist and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beat him in one thing, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What's that, Jim?"</p>

<p>"My wife. He has no wife like mine."</p>

<p>"Has he a wife at all?" asked Mrs. Roberts,
with increased interest. A wife was another
matter.</p>

<p>"I believe not, but if he had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. Did you leave Tom quiet?"</p>

<p>"Hang Tom! he deserves it. And give me
my tea."</p>

<p>Then came the baby, and with it an end, for
the time, of Dale Bannister.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Denborough Determines to Call.</b></p>


<p class="pn p1">"I will awake the world," Dale Bannister
had once declared in the insolence
of youth and talent and the privacy of
a gathering of friends. The boast was
perhaps as little absurd in his mouth as it could
ever be; yet it was very absurd, for the world
sleeps hard, and habit has taught it to slumber
peacefully through the batterings of impatient
genius at its door. At the most, it turns uneasily
on its side, and, with a curse at the meddlesome
fellow, snores again. So Dale Bannister did not
awake the world. But, within a month of his
coming to Littlehill, he performed an exploit
which was, though on a smaller scale, hardly
less remarkable. He electrified Market Denborough,
and the shock penetrated far out into
the surrounding districts of Denshire&mdash;even
Denshire, which, remote from villas and season-tickets,
had almost preserved pristine simplicity.
Men spoke with low-voiced awe and appreciative
twinkling of the eye of the "doings" at
Littlehill: their wives thought that they might
be better employed; and their children hung
about the gates to watch the young man and
his guests come out. There was disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
when no one came to church from Littlehill;
yet there would have been disappointment
if anyone had: it would have jarred with the
fast-growing popular conception of the household.
To the strictness of Denborough morality,
by which no sin was leniently judged save
drunkenness, Littlehill seemed a den of jovial
wickedness, and its inhabitants to reck nothing
of censure, human or divine.</p>

<p>As might be expected by all who knew him,
the Mayor had no hand in this hasty and
uncharitable judgment. London was no
strange land to him; he went up four times a
year to buy his stock; London ways were not
Denshire ways, he admitted, but, for all that,
they were not to be condemned offhand nor
interpreted in the worst light without some
pause for better knowledge.</p>

<p>"It takes all sorts to make a world," said
he, as he drank his afternoon draught at the
"Delane Arms," where the civic aristocracy
was wont to gather.</p>

<p>"He's free enough and to spare with 'is
money," said Alderman Johnstone, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You ought to know, Johnstone," remarked
the Mayor significantly.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't see no 'arm in him," said Mr.
Maggs, the horse-dealer, a rubicund man of
pleasant aspect; "and he's a rare 'un to deal
with."</p>

<p>Interest centered on Mr. Maggs. Apparently
he had spoken with Dale Bannister.</p>

<p>"He's half crazy, o' course," continued that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
gentleman, "but as pleasant-spoken, 'earty a
young gent as I've seen."</p>

<p>"Is he crazy?" asked the girl behind the
bar.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say? He came down
a day or two ago, 'e and 'is friend, Mr.
'Ume&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hume," said the Mayor, with emphasis.
The Mayor, while occasionally following the
worse, saw the better way.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'Ume. Mr. Bannister wanted a 'orse.
'What's your figger, sir?' says I. He took
no notice, but began looking at me with 'is eyes
wide open, for all the world as if I'd never spoke.
Then he says, 'I want a 'orse, broad-backed
and fallen in the vale o' years.' Them was 'is
very words."</p>

<p>"You don't say?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"I never knowed what he meant, no more
than that pint-pot; but Mr. 'Ume laughed and
says, 'Don't be a fool, Dale,' and told me that
Mr. Bannister couldn't ride no more than a
tailor&mdash;so he said&mdash;and wanted a steady, quiet
'orse. He got one from me&mdash;four-and-twenty
years old, warranted not to gallop. I see 'im
on her to day&mdash;and it's lucky she is quiet."</p>

<p>"Can't he ride?"</p>

<p>"No more than"&mdash;a fresh simile failed Mr.
Maggs, and he concluded again&mdash;"that pint-pot.
But Mr. 'Ume can. 'E's a nice set on a
'orse."</p>

<p>The Mayor had been meditating. He was a
little jealous of Mr. Maggs' superior intimacy
with the distinguished stranger, or perhaps it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was merely that he was suddenly struck with a
sense of remissness in his official duties.</p>

<p>"I think," he announced, "of callin' on him
and welcomin' him to the town."</p>

<p>There was a chorus of approbation, broken
only by a sneer from Alderman Johnstone.</p>

<p>"Ay, and take 'im a bottle of that cod-liver
oil of yours at two-and-three. 'E can afford it."</p>

<p>"Not after payin' your bill, Johnstone,"
retorted the Mayor, with a triumphant smile.
A neat repartee maketh glad the heart of the utterer.</p>

<p>The establishment at Littlehill and the proper
course to be pursued in regard to it were also
the subject of consideration in circles more
genteel even than that which gathered at the
"Delane Arms." At Dirkham Grange itself
the topic was discussed, and Mr. Delane was
torn with doubts whether his duty as landlord
called upon him to make Dale Bannister's
acquaintance, or his duty as custodian-general
of the laws and proprieties of life in his corner
of the world forbade any sanction being given to
a household of which such reports were on the
wing. People looked to the Squire, as he was
commonly called, for guidance in social matters,
and he was aware of the responsibility under
which he lay. If he called at Littlehill, half the
county would be likely enough to follow his
example. And perhaps it might not be good
for half the county to know Dale Bannister.</p>

<p>"I must consider the matter," he said at
breakfast.</p>

<p>"Well, one does hear strange things,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
remarked Mrs. Delane. "And aren't his
poems very odd, George?"</p>

<p>The Squire had not accorded to the works
referred to a very close study, but he answered
offhand:</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear so; not at all sound in tone.
But then, my dear, poets have a standard of
their own."</p>

<p>"Of course, there was Byron," said Mrs.
Delane.</p>

<p>"And perhaps we mustn't be too hard on
him," pursued the Squire. "He's a very young
man, and no doubt has considerable ability."</p>

<p>"I dare say he has never met anybody."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, papa," interposed Miss Janet
Delane, "that it would have a good effect on
him to meet us."</p>

<p>Mr. Delane smiled at his daughter.</p>

<p>"Would you like to know him, Jan?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I should! He wouldn't be dull,
at all events, like most of the men about here,
Tora Smith said the Colonel meant to call."</p>

<p>"Colonel Smith is hardly in your father's
position, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, since old Smith had his row with the
War Office about that pension, he'll call on
anybody who's for upsetting everything. It's
enough for him that a man's a Radical."</p>

<p>"Tora means to go, too," said Janet.</p>

<p>"Poor child! It's a pity she hasn't a
mother," said Mrs. Delane.</p>

<p>"I think I shall go. We can drop him if he
turns out badly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, my dear, as you think best."</p>

<p>"I'll walk over on Sunday. I don't suppose
he objects to Sunday calls."</p>

<p>"Not on the ground that he wants to go to
church, at all events," remarked Mrs. Delane.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he goes to chapel, mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear, he doesn't do that." Mrs.
Delane was determined to be just.</p>

<p>"Well, he was the son of a Dissenting minister,
mamma. The <i>Critic</i> said so."</p>

<p>"I wonder what his father thinks of him,"
said the Squire, with a slight chuckle, not knowing
that death had spared Dale's father all
chance of trouble on his son's score.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Roberts told me," said Janet, "that
her husband had been to see him, and liked
him awfully."</p>

<p>"I think Roberts had better have waited,"
the Squire remarked, with a little frown. "In
his position he ought to be very careful what he
does."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be all right if you call, papa."</p>

<p>"It would have been better if he had let me
go first."</p>

<p>Mr. Delane spoke with some severity. Apart
from his position of overlord of Denborough,
which, indeed, he could not but feel was precarious
in these innovating days, he thought he
had special claims to be consulted by the
Doctor. He had taken him up; his influence
had gained him his appointment at Dirkham
and secured him the majority of his more
wealthy <i>clientèle</i>; his good will had opened to
the young unknown man the doors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Grange, and to his wife the privilege of considerable
intimacy with the Grange ladies. It
was certainly a little hasty in the Doctor not to
wait for a lead from the Grange, before he
flung himself into Dale Bannister's arms.</p>

<p>All these considerations were urged by Janet
in her father's defense when his title to approve,
disapprove, or in any way concern himself with
Dr. Roberts' choice of friends and associates
was vigorously questioned by Tora Smith.
Colonel Smith&mdash;he had been Colonel Barrington-Smith,
but he did not see now what a man
wanted with two names&mdash;was, since his difference
with the authorities, a very strong Radical;
on principle he approved of anything of which
his friends and neighbors were likely on principle
to disapprove. Among other such things,
he approved of Dale Bannister's views and
works, and of the Doctor's indifference to Mr.
Delane's opinion. And, just as Janet was more
of a Tory than her father, Tora&mdash;she had been
unhappily baptized in the absurd names of
Victoria Regina in the loyal days before the
grievance; but nothing was allowed to survive
of them which could possibly be dropped&mdash;was
more Radical than her father, and she ridiculed
the Squire's pretensions with an extravagance
which Sir Harry Fulmer, who was calling at the
Smiths' when Janet came in, thought none the
less charming for being very unreasonable. Sir
Harry, however, suppressed his opinion on both
these points&mdash;as to its being charming, because
matters had not yet reached the stage
when he could declare it, and as to its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
unreasonable, because he was by hereditary
right the head of the Liberal party in the district,
and tried honestly to live up to the position
by a constant sacrifice of his dearest prejudices
on the altar of progress.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said in reply to an appeal
from Tora, "that a man has a right to please
himself in such things."</p>

<p>"After all papa has done for him! Besides,
Sir Harry, you know a doctor ought to be particularly
careful."</p>

<p>"What is there so dreadful about Mr. Bannister?"
asked Tora. "He looks very nice."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him, Tora?" asked Janet
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes; we met him riding on such a queer old
horse. He looked as if he was going to tumble
off every minute; he can't ride a bit. But he's
awfully handsome."</p>

<p>"What's he like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, tall, not very broad, with beautiful eyes,
and a lot of waving auburn hair; he doesn't
wear it clipped like a toothbrush. And he's
got a long mustache, and a straight nose, and
a charming smile. Hasn't he, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice particularly. He's not a
bad-looking chap. Looks a bit soft, though."</p>

<p>"Soft? why, he's a tremendous genius, papa
says."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that; I mean flabby and out
of training, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, he isn't always shooting or hunting, of
course," said Tora contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose," remarked Janet, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in his position of life,&mdash;well, you know, Tora,
he's of quite humble birth,&mdash;he ever had the
chance."</p>

<p>"He's none the worse for that," said Sir
Harry stoutly.</p>

<p>"The worse? I think he's the better. Papa
is going to ask him here."</p>

<p>"You're quite enthusiastic, Tora."</p>

<p>"I love to meet new people. One sees the
same faces year after year in Denshire."</p>

<p>Sir Harry felt that this remark was a little
unkind.</p>

<p>"I like old friends," he said, "better than
new ones."</p>

<p>Janet rose to go.</p>

<p>"We must wait and hear papa's report," she
said, as she took her leave.</p>

<p>Tora Smith escorted her to the door, kissed
her, and, returning, said, with a snap of her
fingers:</p>

<p>"I don't care that for 'papa's report.' Jan
is really too absurd."</p>

<p>"It's nice to see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, delightful. I hate dutiful people!"</p>

<p>"You think just as much of your father."</p>

<p>"We happen to agree in our opinions, but
papa always tells me to use my own judgment.
Are you going to see Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. He won't hurt me, and he
may subscribe to the hunt."</p>

<p>"No; he may even improve you."</p>

<p>"Do I want it so badly, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You're a weak-kneed man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! Look here, you must help me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I will, if Mr. Bannister is not too
engrossing."</p>

<p>"Now you're trying to draw me."</p>

<p>"Was I? And yet you looked pleased.
Perhaps you think it a compliment."</p>

<p>"Isn't it one? It shows you think it worth
while to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It shows nothing of the kind," said Tora
decisively.</p>

<p>Thus, for one reason or another, from one
direction and another, there was converging on
Littlehill a number of visitors. If your neighbor
excites curiosity, it is a dull imagination
that finds no plausible reason for satisfying it.
Probably there was more in common than at
first sight appeared between Mr. Delane's sense
of duty, the Mayor's idea of official courtesy,
Colonel Smith's contempt for narrowness of
mind, Sir Harry Fulmer's care for the interests
of the hunt, and Dr. Roberts' frank and undisguised
eagerness to see and speak with Dale
Bannister face to face.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Quiet Sunday Afternoon.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">To dissolve public report into its component
parts is never a light task.
Analysis, as a rule, reveals three constituents:
truth, embroidery, and mere
falsehood; but the proportions vary infinitely.
Denborough, which went to bed, to a man, at
ten o'clock, or so soon after as it reached home
from the public house, said that the people at
Littlehill sat up very late; this was truth, at
least relative truth, and that is all we can expect
here. It said that they habitually danced and
sang the night through; this was embroidery;
they had once danced and sung the night
through, when Dale had a party from London.
It said that orgies&mdash;if the meaning of its nods,
winks, and smiles may be summarized&mdash;went
on at Littlehill; this was falsehood. Dale and
his friends amused themselves, and it must be
allowed that their enjoyment was not marred,
but rather increased, by the knowledge that
they did not command the respect of Denborough.
They had no friends there. Why
should they care for Denborough's approval?
Denborough's approval was naught, whereas
Denborough's disapproval ministered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
pleasure most of us feel in giving gentle shocks
to our neighbors' sense of propriety. No doubt
an electric eel enjoys itself. But, after all, if
the mere truth must be told, they were mild
sinners at Littlehill, the leading spirits, Dale and
Arthur Angell, being indeed young men whose
antinomianism found a harmless issue in ink,
and whose lawlessness was best expressed in
meter. A cynic once married his daughter to a
professed atheist, on the ground that the man
could not afford to be other than an exemplary
husband and father. Poets are not trammeled
so tight as that, for, as Mrs. Delane remarked,
there was Byron, and perhaps one or two more;
yet, for the most part, she who marries a poet
has nothing worse than nerves to fear. But a
little lawlessness will go a long way in the right
place,&mdash;for example, lawn-tennis on Sunday in
the suburbs,&mdash;and the Littlehill party extorted a
gratifying meed of curiosity and frowns, which
were not entirely undeserved by some of their
doings, and were more than deserved by what
was told of their doings.</p>

<p>After luncheon on Sunday, Mr. Delane had
a nap, as his commendable custom was. Then
he took his hat and stick and set out for Littlehill.
The Grange park stretches to the outskirts
of the town, and borders in part on the
grounds of Littlehill, so that the Squire had a
pleasant walk under the cool shade of his own
immemorial elms, and enjoyed the satisfaction
of inspecting his own most excellent shorthorns.
Reflecting on the elms and the shorthorns, and
on the house, the acres, and the family that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
were his, he admitted that he had been born to
advantages and opportunities such as fell to the
lot of a few men; and, inspired to charity by the
distant church-bell sounding over the meadows,
he acknowledged a corresponding duty of lenient
judgment in respect of the less fortunate.
Thus he arrived at Littlehill in a tolerant temper,
and contented himself with an indulgent
shake of the head when he saw the gravel fresh
marked with horses' hoofs.</p>

<p>"Been riding instead of going to church, the
young rascals," he said to himself, as he rang
the bell.</p>

<p>A small, shrewd-faced man opened the door
and ushered Mr. Delane into the hall. Then
he stopped.</p>

<p>"If you go straight on, sir," said he,
"through that baize door, and across the
passage, and through the opposite door, you
will find Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>Mr. Delane's face expressed surprise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bannister, sir," the man explained,
"don't like visitors being announced, sir. If
you would be so kind as walk in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was a harmless whim, and the Squire
nodded assent. He passed through the baize
door, crossed the passage, and paused before
opening the opposite door. The sounds which
came from behind it arrested his attention.
To the accompaniment of a gentle drumming
noise, as if of sticks or umbrellas bumped
against the floor, a voice was declaiming, or
rather chanting, poetry. The voice rose and
fell, and Mr. Delane could not distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the words, until it burst forth triumphantly
with the lines:</p>

<p class="pl0">"Love grows hate for love's sake, life takes death for guide;</p>
<p class="pl1">Night hath none but one red star&mdash;Tyrannicide."</p>

<p class="p1">"Good gracious!" said Mr. Delane.</p>

<p>The voice dropped again for a few moments,
then it hurled out:</p>

<p class="pl0">"Down the way of Tsars awhile in vain deferred,</p>
<p class="pl1">Bid the Second Alexander light the Third.</p>
<p class="pl1">How for shame shall men rebuke them? how may we</p>
<p class="pl1">Blame, whose fathers died and slew, to leave us free?"</p>

<p class="p1">The voice was interrupted and drowned by
the crash of the pianoforte, struck with remorseless
force, and another voice, the voice of a
woman, cried, rising even above the crash:</p>

<p>"Now, one of your own, Dale."</p>

<p>"I think I'd better go in," thought Mr. Delane,
and he knocked loudly at the door.</p>

<p>He was bidden to enter by the former of the
two voices, and, going in, found himself in a
billiard room. Five or six people sat round the
wall on settees, each holding a cue, with which
they were still gently strumming on the floor.
A stout, elderly woman was at the piano, and
a young man sat cross-legged in the middle of
the billiard-table, with a book in one hand and
a cigar in the other. There was a good deal
of tobacco smoke in the room, and Mr. Delane
did not at first distinguish the faces of the company.</p>

<p>The young man on the table uncoiled himself
with great agility, jumped down, and came forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to meet the newcomer with outstretched
hands. As he outstretched them, he dropped
the book and the cigar to the ground on either
side of him.</p>

<p>"Ah, here you are! Delightful of you to
come!" he cried. "Now, let me guess you!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bannister?&mdash;Have I the pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Now let's see&mdash;don't tell me your
name."</p>

<p>He drew back a step, surveyed Mr. Delane's
portly figure, his dignified carriage, his plain
solid watch-chain, his square-toed strong boots.</p>

<p>"The Squire!" he exclaimed. "Mr. Delane,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Delane."</p>

<p>"Good! You don't mind being guessed, do
you? It's so much more amusing. What will
you have?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I've lunched, Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"Have you? We've just breakfasted&mdash;had a
ride before, you know. But I must introduce
you."</p>

<p>He searched the floor, picked up the cigar,
looked at it regretfully, and threw it out of an
open window.</p>

<p>"This," he resumed, waving his hand toward
the piano, "is Mrs. Ernest Hodge. This is Miss
Fane, Mrs. Hodge's daughter&mdash;no, not by a
first marriage; everybody suggests that. Professional
name, you know&mdash;she sings. Hodge
really wouldn't do, would it, Mrs. Hodge? This
is Philip Hume. This is Arthur Angell, who
writes verses&mdash;like me. This is&mdash;but I expect
you know these gentlemen?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Delane peered through the smoke which
Philip Hume was producing from a long pipe,
and to his amazement discerned three familiar
faces: those of Dr. Roberts, the Mayor, and
Alderman Johnstone. The Doctor was flushed
and looked excited; the Mayor was a picture
of dignified complacency; Johnstone appeared
embarrassed and uncomfortable, for his bald
head was embellished with a flowery garland.
Dale saw Mr. Delane's eyes rest on this article.</p>

<p>"We always crown anybody who adds to our
knowledge," he explained. "He gets a wreath
of honor. The Alderman added to our knowledge
of the expense of building a room. So
Miss Fane crowned him."</p>

<p>An appreciative chuckle from the Mayor followed
this explanation; he knocked the butt of
his cue against the floor, and winked at Philip
Hume.</p>

<p>The last-named, seeing that Mr. Delane was
somewhat surprised at the company, came up
to him and said:</p>

<p>"Come and sit down; Dale never remembers
that anybody wants a seat. Here's an armchair."</p>

<p>Mr. Delane sat down next to Miss Fane, and
noticed, even in his perturbation, that his neighbor
was a remarkably pretty girl, with fair hair
clustering in a thick mass on the nape of her
neck, and large blue eyes which left gazing on
Dale Bannister when their owner turned to
greet him. Mr. Delane would have enjoyed
talking to her, had not his soul been vexed at
the presence of the three Denborough men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
One did not expect to meet the tradesmen of
the town; and what business had the Doctor
there? To spend Sunday in that fashion would
not increase his popularity or his practice.
And then that nonsense about the wreath!
How undignified it was! it was even worse
than yelling out Nihilistic verses by way of Sabbath
amusement.</p>

<p>"I shall get away as soon as I can," he
thought, "and I shall say a word to the Doctor."</p>

<p>He was called from his meditations by Miss
Fane. She sat in a low chair with her feet on
a stool, and now, tilting the chair back, she
fixed her eyes on Mr. Delane, and asked:</p>

<p>"Are you shocked?"</p>

<p>No man likes to admit that he is shocked.</p>

<p>"I am not, but many people would be."</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't like meeting those
men?"</p>

<p>"Hedger is an honest man in his way of life.
I have no great opinion of Johnstone."</p>

<p>"This is your house, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All the houses about here are yours, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Most of them are, Miss Fane."</p>

<p>"Then you are a great man?"</p>

<p>The question was put so simply that Mr.
Delane could not suspect a sarcastic intent.</p>

<p>"Only locally," he answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"Have you any daughters?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; one."</p>

<p>"What is she like?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fancy asking her father! I think Janet a
beauty."</p>

<p>"Fair or dark?"</p>

<p>"Dark."</p>

<p>"Dale likes dark girls. Tall or short?"</p>

<p>"Tall."</p>

<p>"Good eyes?"</p>

<p>"I like them."</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll do. Dale will like her;" and
Miss Fane nodded reassuringly. Mr. Delane
had not the heart to intimate his indifference to
Dale Bannister's opinion of his daughter.</p>

<p>"Do you know this country?" he asked, by
way of conversation.</p>

<p>"We've only been here a week, but we've
ridden a good deal. We hold Dale on, you
know."</p>

<p>"You are on a visit to Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mother and I are here."</p>

<p>Mr. Delane could not help wondering
whether their presence was such a matter of
course as her tone implied, but before he could
probe the matter further, he heard Dale
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a wretched thing! Read it yourself,
Roberts."</p>

<p>"Mount him on the rostrum," cried the young
man who had been presented to Mr. Delane as
Arthur Angell, and who had hitherto been
engaged in an animated discussion with the
Doctor.</p>

<p>Laughing, and only half resisting, the Doctor
allowing himself to be hoisted on to the billiard-table,
sat down, and announced in a loud voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Blood for Blood': by Dale Bannister."</p>

<p>The poem which bore this alarming title was
perhaps the most outrageous of the author's
works. It held up to ridicule and devoted to
damnation every person and every institution
which the Squire respected and worshiped.
And the misguided young man declaimed it
with sparkling eyes and emphasizing gestures,
as though every wicked word of it were gospel.
And to this man's charge were committed the
wives and families of the citizens of Denborough!
The Squire's self-respect demanded
a protest. He rose with dignity, and went up
to his host.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"What? you're not going yet? What?
Does this stuff bore you?"</p>

<p>"It does not bore me. But I must add&mdash;excuse
an old-fashioned fellow&mdash;that it does
something worse."</p>

<p>"What? Oh, you're on the other side? Of
course you are!"</p>

<p>"Whatever side I was, I could not listen to
that. As an older man, let me give you a word
of advice."</p>

<p>Dale lifted his hands in good-humored protest.</p>

<p>"Sorry you don't like it," he said. "Shut up,
Roberts! If I'd known, we wouldn't have had
it. But it's true&mdash;true&mdash;true."</p>

<p>The Doctor listened with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"I must differ utterly; I must indeed. Good-by,
Mr. Bannister. Hedger?"</p>

<p>The Mayor started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am walking into the town. Come with
me."</p>

<p>The Mayor wavered. The Squire stood and
waited for him.</p>

<p>"I didn't think of goin' yet, Mr. Delane, sir."</p>

<p>Dale watched the encounter with a smile.</p>

<p>"Your wife will expect you," said the Squire.
"Come along."</p>

<p>The Mayor rose, ignoring Johnstone's grin
and the amusement on the faces of the company.</p>

<p>"I'll come and look you up," said Dale,
pressing the Squire's hand warmly. "Oh, it's
all right. Tastes differ. I'm not offended.
I'll come some day this week."</p>

<p>He showed them out, and, returning, said to
the Doctor, "Roberts, you'll get into trouble."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the Doctor. "What
business is it of his?"</p>

<p>Dale had turned to Johnstone.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said he abruptly. "We close at
five."</p>

<p>"I've 'ad a pleasant afternoon, sir."</p>

<p>"It will be deducted from your bill," answered
Dale.</p>

<p>After ejecting Johnstone, he stood by the
table, looking moodily at the floor.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Dale?" asked Miss
Fane.</p>

<p>"I suppose he thought we were beasts or
lunatics."</p>

<p>"Probably," said Philip Hume. "What
then?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," answered Dale, smiling again.
"You're quite right, Phil. What then?"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>The Necessary Scapegoat.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">If men never told their wives anything,
the condition of society would no doubt
be profoundly modified, though it is not
easy to forecast the precise changes.
If a guess may be hazarded, it is probable that
much less good would be done, and some less
evil said: the loss of matter of interest for half
the world may be allowed to sway the balance
in favor of the present practice&mdash;a practice so
universal that Mr. Delane, the Mayor, and
Alderman Johnstone, one and all, followed it
by telling their wives about their Sunday afternoon
at Littlehill. Dr. Roberts, it is true, gave
a meager account to his wife, but the narratives
of the other three amply filled the gaps
he left, and, as each of them naturally dwelt
on the most remarkable features of their entertainment,
it may be supposed that the general
impression produced in Market Denborough
did not fall short of the truth in vividness of
color. The facts as to what occurred have
been set down without extenuation and without
malice: the province of Market Denborough
society was to supply the inferences arising
therefrom, and this task it fulfilled with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
grudging hand. Before eight-and-forty hours
had passed, there were reports that the Squire
had discovered a full-blown Saturnalia in process
at Littlehill&mdash;and that in these scandalous
proceedings the Mayor, Alderman Johnstone,
and Dr. Roberts were participators.</p>

<p>Then ensued conduct on the part of the
Mayor and the Alderman deserving of unmeasured
scorn. They could not deny that
dreadful things had been done and said, though
they had not seen the deeds nor understood the
words: their denial would have had no chance
of credit. They could not venture to say that
Squire Delane had done anything except manfully
protest. They began by accusing one
another in round terms, but each found himself
so vulnerable that by an unholy tacit compact
they agreed to exonerate one another.
The Mayor allowed that Johnstone was not conspicuous
in wickedness; Johnstone admitted
that the Mayor had erred, if at all, only through
weakness and good-nature. Public opinion
demanded a sacrifice; and the Doctor was left
to satisfy it. Everybody was of one mind in
holding that Dr. Roberts had disgraced himself,
and nobody was surprised to hear that the
Squire's phaeton had been seen standing at his
door for half an hour on Wednesday morning.
The Squire was within, and was understood to
be giving the Doctor a piece of his mind.</p>

<p>The Doctor was stiff-necked.</p>

<p>"It is entirely a private matter," said he,
"and no one has a right to dictate to me."</p>

<p>"My dear Roberts, I spoke merely in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
own interest. It would ruin you if it became
known that you held those atrocious opinions;
and become known it must, if you openly ally
yourself with this young man."</p>

<p>"I am not the servant of the people I attend.
I may choose my own opinions."</p>

<p>"Yes, and they may choose their own doctor,"
retorted the Squire.</p>

<p>The two parted, almost quarreling. Perhaps
they would have quite quarreled had not the
Squire thought of Mrs. Roberts and the baby.
He wondered that the Doctor did not think of
them, too, but he seemed to Mr. Delane to be
under such a spell that he thought of nothing
but Dale Bannister. It was not as if Roberts
were the only medical man in the place. There
was young Doctor Spink&mdash;and he was a real
M. D.&mdash;up the street, ready and eager to snap
up stray patients. And Doctor Spink was a
churchwarden. The Squire did not like him
overmuch, but he found himself thinking
whether it would not be well to send for him
next time there was a case of illness at the
Grange.</p>

<p>The Squire meditated, while others acted.
On her walk the same afternoon, Ethel Roberts
heard news which perturbed her. The Vicar's
wife was ill and Dr. Spink had been sent for.
The Vicar was a well-to-do man. He had a
large family, which yet grew. He had been a
constant and a valuable client of her husband's.
And now Dr. Spink was sent for.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, "did you know that Mrs.
Gilkison was ill?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ill?" said the Doctor, looking up from
"Sluggards." "No, I've heard nothing of it."</p>

<p>She came and leaned over his chair.</p>

<p>"They've sent for Dr. Spink," she said.</p>

<p>"What?" he exclaimed, dropping his beloved
volume.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hedger told me."</p>

<p>"Well, they can do as they like. I suppose
his 'Doctor' is the attraction."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's that, dear?"</p>

<p>"What else can it be?&mdash;unless it's a mere
freak."</p>

<p>"Well, Jim, I thought&mdash;I thought perhaps
that the Vicar had heard about&mdash;about&mdash;Littlehill.
Yes, I know it's very stupid and narrow,
dear&mdash;but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Doctor swore under his breath.</p>

<p>"I can't help it if the man's an ass," he said.</p>

<p>Ethel smiled patiently.</p>

<p>"It's a pity to offend people, Jim, dear, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Are you against me too, Ethel?"</p>

<p>"Against you? You know I never would
be, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then do let us leave Denborough gossip
alone. Fancy Denborough taking on itself to
disapprove of Dale Bannister! It's too rich!"</p>

<p>Ethel sighed. Denborough's disapproval
was no doubt a matter of indifference to Dale
Bannister: it meant loss of bread and butter
to James Roberts and his house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dale Bannister, all unconscious of
the dread determinations of the Vicar, pursued
his way in cheerful unconcern. People came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and went. Arthur Angell returned to his
haunts rather dissatisfied with the quiet of
Littlehill, but rejoicing to have found in the
Doctor one thorough-going believer. Mrs.
Hodge, her daughter, and Philip Hume seemed
to be permanent parts of the household. Riding
was their chief amusement. They would pass
down High Street, Dale on his ancient mare,
with Nellie and Philip by his side, laughing and
talking merrily, Dale's own voice being very
audible as he pointed out, with amusement a
trifle too obvious to be polite, what struck him
as remarkable in Denborough ways of life.</p>

<p>Philip, however, whom Mr. Delane had
described to his wife as the only apparently
sane person at Littlehill, was rather uneasy in
his mind about Roberts.</p>

<p>"You'll get that fellow disliked, Dale," he
said one morning, "if you don't take care."</p>

<p>"I? What have I to do with it?" asked
Dale.</p>

<p>"They'll think him unsafe, if they see him
with you."</p>

<p>"He needn't come unless he likes. He's not
a bad fellow, only he takes everything so precious
seriously."</p>

<p>"He thinks you do, judging by your books."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do by fits. By the way, I have a fit
now! Behold, I will write! Nellie! Where's
Nellie?"</p>

<p>Nellie Fane came at his call.</p>

<p>"Sit down just opposite me, and look at me.
I am going to write. The editor of the <i>Cynosure</i>
begs for twenty lines&mdash;no more; twenty lines&mdash;fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
pounds! Now, Nellie, inspire me, and
you shall have a new hat out of it. No, look
at me!"</p>

<p>Nellie sat down and gazed at him, obediently.</p>

<p>"Two pound ten a line; not bad for a young
'un," he pursued. "They say Byron wrote on
gin and water. I write on your eyes, Nellie&mdash;much
better."</p>

<p>"You're not writing at all&mdash;only talking
nonsense."</p>

<p>"I'm just beginning."</p>

<p>"Look here, Dale, why don't you keep the
Doctor&mdash;&mdash;" began Philip.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang the Doctor! I'd just got an idea.
Look at me, Nellie!"</p>

<p>Philip shrugged his shoulders, and Dr.
Roberts dropped out of discussion.</p>

<p>The twenty lines were written, though they
were never considered one of his masterpieces,
then Dale rose with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Now for lunch, and then I'm going to return
Mr. Delane's call."</p>

<p>"I thought we were to ride," said Nellie
disappointedly.</p>

<p>"Well, won't you come?"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd!"</p>

<p>"Mightn't she come, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Delane has not called, has she?" inquired
Philip, as though for information.</p>

<p>"Of course I shan't go, Dale. You must go
alone."</p>

<p>"What a nuisance! I shall have to walk. I
daren't trust myself to that animal alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>After luncheon he started, walking by the
same way by which Mr. Delane had come.</p>

<p>He reached the lodge of the Grange; a courtesying
child held open the gate, and he passed
along under the immemorial elms, returning a
cheery good-day to the gardeners, who paused
in their work to touch their hats with friendly
deference. The deference was wrong, of course,
but the friendliness pleased him, and even the
deference seemed somehow in keeping with the
elms and with the sturdy old red-brick mansion,
with its coat of arms and defiant Norman motto
over the principal door. Littlehill was a
pleasant house, but it had none of the ancient
dignity of Dirkham, and Dale's quick brain was
suddenly struck with a new understanding of
how such places bred the men they did. He
had had a fancy for a stay in the country; it
would amuse him, he thought, to study country
life; that was the meaning of his coming to
Littlehill. Well, Dirkham summed up one side
of country life, and he would be glad to study it.</p>

<p>Mr. Delane was not at home&mdash;he had gone
to Petty Sessions; and Dale, with regret, for he
wanted to see the inside of the house, left his
name&mdash;as usual he had forgotten to bring a
card&mdash;and turned away. As he turned, a pony
carriage drew up and a girl jumped out. Dale
drew back to let her pass, raising his hat. The
servant said a word to her, and when he had
gone some ten or fifteen yards, he heard his
name called.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Bannister, do come in! I expect
papa back every minute, and he will be so sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to miss you. Mamma is up in London; but I
hope you'll come in."</p>

<p>Dale had no idea of refusing the invitation
given so cordially. He had been sorry to go
away before, and the sight of Janet Delane
made him more reluctant still. He followed
her into the oak-paneled hall, hung with
pictures of dead Delanes and furnished with
couches and easy-chairs.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, after tea was brought, "and
what do you think of us?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen very much of you yet."</p>

<p>"As far as you have gone? And be candid."</p>

<p>"You are very restful."</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"You mean very slow?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't! I think you very interesting."</p>

<p>"You find us interesting, but slow. Yes, you
meant that, Mr. Bannister, and it's not kind."</p>

<p>"Have your revenge by telling me what you
think of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, we find you interesting, too. We're all
talking about you."</p>

<p>"And slow?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not slow," she said, with a
smile and a glance: the glance should be
described, if it were describable, but it was not.</p>

<p>Dale, however, understood it, for he replied,
laughing:</p>

<p>"They've been prejudicing you against me."</p>

<p>"I don't despair of you. I think you may be
reformed. But I'm afraid you're very bad just
now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you think that? From what your
father said?"</p>

<p>"Partly. Partly also because Colonel Smith
and Tora&mdash;do you know them?&mdash;are so enthusiastic
about you."</p>

<p>"Is that a bad sign?"</p>

<p>"Terrible. They are quite revolutionary.
So are you, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Not in private life."</p>

<p>"But of course," she asked, with serious eyes,
"you believe what you write?"</p>

<p>"Well, I do; but you pay writers a compliment
by saying 'of course.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not! Anything is better than
insincerity."</p>

<p>"Even my opinions?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Opinions may be changed, but not
natures, you know."</p>

<p>She was still looking at him with serious,
inquiring eyes. The eyes were very fine eyes.
Perhaps that was the reason why Dale thought
the last remark so excellent. He said nothing,
and she went on:</p>

<p>"People who are clever and&mdash;and great, you
know, ought to be so careful that they are right,
oughtn't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a rhymer rhymes as the fit takes him,"
answered he, with affected modesty.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe that of you. You wouldn't
misuse your powers like that."</p>

<p>"You have read my poetry?"</p>

<p>"Some of it." She paused and added, with
a little blush for her companion: "There was
some papa would not let me read."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>A man may not unreasonably write what
a young girl's father may very reasonably not
like her to read. Nevertheless, Dale Bannister
felt rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Those were the shocking political ones,
I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; I read most of those. These were
against religion and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Morality, papa said," she answered, with
the same grave look of inquiry.</p>

<p>Dale rose and held out his hand, saying
petulantly:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Delane. You evidently
don't think me fit to enter your house."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I have made you angry. I have
no right to speak about it, and, of course, I
know nothing about it. Only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>"Some things are right and some are wrong,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, granted&mdash;if we could only agree which
were which."</p>

<p>"As to some we have been told. And I don't
think that about you at all&mdash;I really don't. Do
wait till papa comes."</p>

<p>Dale sat down again. He had had his lecture;
experience told him that a lecture from
such lecturers is tolerably often followed by
a petting, and the pettings were worth the lectures.
In this instance he was disappointed.
Janet did not pet him, though she displayed
much friendliness, and he took his leave (for the
Squire did not appear) feeling somewhat put out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Approbation and applause were dear to this
man, who seemed to spend his energies in
courting blame and distrust; whatever people
thought of his writings, he wished them to be
fascinated by him. He was not sure that he
had fascinated Miss Delane.</p>

<p>"I should like to see more of her," he thought.
"She's rather an odd girl."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Littlehill Goes into Society.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Mr. Delane's late return from his
public duties was attributable simply
to Colonel Smith's obstinacy. He
and the Colonel sat together on the
bench, and very grievously did they quarrel over
the case of a man who had been caught in the
possession of the body of a fresh-killed hare.
They differed first as to the policy of the law,
secondly as to its application, thirdly as to its
vindication; and when the Vicar of Denborough,
who was a county justice and present
with them, sided with the Squire on all
these points, the Colonel angrily denounced the
reverend gentleman as a disgrace, not only to
the judicial bench, but even to his own cloth.
All this took time, as did also the Colonel's
cross-examination of the constable in charge of
the case, and it was evening before the dispute
was ended, and a fine imposed. The Colonel
paid the fine, and thus everyone, including the
law and the prisoner, was in the end satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. Delane and the Colonel, widely and
fiercely as they differed on every subject under
the sun, were very good friends, and they rode
home together in the dusk of a September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
evening, for their roads lay the same way for
some distance. Presently they fell in with Sir
Harry Fulmer, who had been to see Dale Bannister,
and, in his absence, had spent the afternoon
with Nellie Fane and Philip Hume.</p>

<p>"Hume's quite a good fellow," he declared;
"quiet, you know, and rather sarcastic, but
quite a gentleman. And Miss Fane&mdash;I say,
have you seen her, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"By the way, who is Miss Fane?" asked the
Squire.</p>

<p>"Oh, she acts, or sings, or something.
Awfully jolly girl, and uncommon pretty.
Don't you think so, Squire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, Harry. But why is she staying
there?"</p>

<p>"Really, Delane," said the Colonel, "what
possible business is that of yours?"</p>

<p>"I've called on Bannister, and he's going to
return my call. I think it's a good deal of
business of mine."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the Colonel; "for sheer
uncharitableness and the thinking of all evil,
give me a respectable Christian man like yourself,
Delane."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Sir Harry cheerfully.
"The old lady, Mrs. What's-her-name, is
there."</p>

<p>"I hope it is," said the Squire. "Bannister
has himself to thank for any suspicions which
may be aroused."</p>

<p>"Suspicions? Bosh!" said the Colonel.
"They are all coming to dine with me to-morrow.
I met Bannister and asked him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
said he had friends, and I told him to bring
the lot. Will you and Mrs. Delane come,
Squire?"</p>

<p>"My wife's away, thanks."</p>

<p>"Then bring Janet."</p>

<p>"Hum! I think I'll wait."</p>

<p>"Oh, as you please. You'll come, Harry?"</p>

<p>Sir Harry was delighted to come.</p>

<p>"Tora was most anxious to know them," the
Colonel continued, "and I hate ceremonious
ways. There'll be nobody else, except the
Doctor and his wife."</p>

<p>"You haven't asked Hedger and Johnstone,
have you?" inquired the Squire. "They're
friends of Bannister's. I met them at his
house."</p>

<p>"I haven't, but I don't know why I
shouldn't."</p>

<p>"Still you won't," said Sir Harry, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>The Colonel knew that he would not, and
changed the subject.</p>

<p class="p2">"This is a great occasion," said Philip Hume
at afternoon tea next day. "To-night we are
to be received into county society."</p>

<p>"Is Colonel Smith 'county society'?" asked
Nellie.</p>

<p>"Yes. The Mayor told me so. The Colonel
is a Radical, and a bad one at that, but the poor
man comes of good family and is within the
toils."</p>

<p>"I expect he really likes it," said Nellie, "I
should."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you nervous?" inquired Philip.</p>

<p>Nellie laughed and colored.</p>

<p>"I really am a little. I hope I shall behave
properly. Mother is in a dreadful state."</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Hodge?"</p>

<p>"Putting some new lace on her gown."</p>

<p>"And Dale?"</p>

<p>"He's writing. Mr. Hume, has he told you
anything about his visit yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He says he met an angel."</p>

<p>"Oh, that accounts for the title."</p>

<p>"What title?"</p>

<p>"Why, I went and looked over his shoulder,
and saw he was beginning some verses, headed,
'To a Pretty Saint.' I always look, you know,
but this time he snatched the paper away."</p>

<p>"'To a Pretty Saint'? Dear, dear! Perhaps
he meant you, Nellie."</p>

<p>Miss Fane shook her head.</p>

<p>"He meant Miss Delane, I'm sure," she said
dolefully. "I hope Miss Smith is just exactly
a county young lady&mdash;you know what I mean.
I want to see one."</p>

<p>"Do you contemplate remodeling yourself?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure Dale will like that sort of girl."</p>

<p>Philip looked at her sideways. He thought
of telling her that "county young ladies" did
not proclaim all their thoughts. But then he
reflected that he would not.</p>

<p>The Littlehill party arrived at Mount Pleasant,
the Colonel's residence, in the nick of time;
and Mrs. Hodge sailed in to dinner on her
host's arm in high good humor. Dale, as the
great man and the stranger, escorted Tora,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Philip Hume Mrs. Roberts, and Sir Harry fell
to Nellie's lot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodge was an amusing companion.
She did not dally at the outworks of acquaintance,
but closed at once into intimacy, and
before half an hour was gone, she found herself
trying hard not to call the Colonel "my dear,"
and to remember to employ the usual prefixes
to the names of the company. The Colonel
was delighted; was he at last escaping from
the stifling prison of conventionality and breathing
a freer air?</p>

<p>Unhappily, just in proportion as good cheer
and good fellowship put Mrs. Hodge at her
ease, and made her more and more to the
Colonel's taste, her daughter's smothered uneasiness
grew more intense. Nellie had borne
herself with an impossible dignity and distance
of manner toward Sir Harry, in the fear lest
Sir Harry should find her wanting in the characteristics
of good society, and her frigidity was
increased by her careful watch on her mother's
conduct. Sir Harry was disappointed. As
he could not sit by Tora Smith, he had consoled
himself with the prospect of some fun with
"little Miss Fane." And little Miss Fane held
him at arms'-length. He determined to try to
break down her guard.</p>

<p>"How did you manage to shock the Squire
so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Was he shocked? I didn't know."</p>

<p>"You were there, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Well, I suppose it was Mr. Bannister's
poetry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should that shock him?" asked Sir
Harry, who knew very well. "By Jove, I wish
I could write some like it!"</p>

<p>She turned to him with sudden interest.</p>

<p>"Do you admire Dale's writings?"</p>

<p>"Awfully," said Sir Harry. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course <i>I</i> do, but I didn't know whether
you would. Do you know Miss Delane?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very well."</p>

<p>"Do you like her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I have known her all my life, and I
like her. She frightens me a little, you know."</p>

<p>"Does she? How?"</p>

<p>"She expects such a lot of a fellow. Have
you met her?"</p>

<p>"No. D&mdash;Mr. Bannister has. He likes her."</p>

<p>"I expect she blew him up, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't think so. Dale wouldn't
like that."</p>

<p>"Depends how it's done," observed Sir
Harry. "Don't you ever blow him up?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I'm much too&mdash;I look up to
him too much."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the Colonel's voice.
He was saying, with much energy:</p>

<p>"Ability we don't expect in a Government
office, but honesty one might hope for."</p>

<p>"Just what Hodge used to say of old Pratt,"
said Mrs. Hodge.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon?" said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Pratt was his manager, you know&mdash;my
husband's."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Nellie, you remember your father throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
down that two pound ten on the table, and saying,
'Well, I'm&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"No, mother, I don't. Do you think I could
learn to hunt, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"Of course you could, in no time."</p>

<p>"Does Miss Delane?"</p>

<p>"And Pratt said that if Hodge couldn't play
the king at two pound ten a week,&mdash;though
that's hard living, my dear,&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;Colonel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Colonel bowed courteously. Nellie grew
very red.</p>

<p>"Why, bantam-cocks had risen since his day,
and that was all about it." And Mrs. Hodge
emptied her glass and beamed pleasantly on the
company.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dale Bannister began to laugh
gently. Tora Smith turned an inquiring look
in his direction.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>"I saw your father's butler looking at my
friend Mrs. Hodge."</p>

<p>"What nonsense! Simmons is not allowed
to look at anyone."</p>

<p>"Isn't he? Why not?"</p>

<p>"No good servant does."</p>

<p>Dale smiled.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," Tora continued;
"but surely while they're actually waiting, Mr.
Bannister, we can't treat them quite like ourselves?
At any other time, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd take a walk with them?"</p>

<p>"They'd be horribly uncomfortable if I did,"
she answered, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the worst of it," said he.</p>

<p>"Do you think us great shams?"</p>

<p>"I have come to learn, not to criticise."</p>

<p>"We want a leader," said Tora, with pretty
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Haven't you one?"</p>

<p>"Sir Harry Fulmer is our leader, but we're
not contented with him. He's a very mild
Radical. Won't you come to our help?"</p>

<p>"I expect I should be too extreme the other
way."</p>

<p>"Oh, I love people who are extreme&mdash;in my
direction, I mean."</p>

<p>"Well, then, try the Doctor."</p>

<p>"Mr. Roberts? Oh, he's hardly prominent
enough; we must have somebody of position.
Now, what are you laughing at, Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>The gentleman to whom they referred sat
looking on at them with no great pleasure,
though they found one another entertaining
enough to prevent them noticing him. Dale
Bannister said that his new friend took life
seriously, and the charge was too true for the
Doctor's happiness. Dale Bannister had taken
hold of his imagination. He expected Dale to
do all he would give his life to see done, but
could not do himself. The effect of Dale was
to be instantaneous, enormous, transforming
Denborough and its inhabitants. He regarded
the poet much as a man might look upon a
benevolent volcano, did such a thing exist in
the order of nature. His function was, in the
Doctor's eyes, to pour forth the burning lava
of truth and justice, wherewith the ignorance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
prejudice, and cruelty of the present order
should be consumed and smothered; let the
flood be copious, scorching, and unceasing!
The Doctor could do little more than hail the
blessed shower and declare its virtues; but
that he was ready to do at any cost. And the
volcano would not act! The eruptions were
sadly intermittent. The hero, instead of going
forth to war, was capering nimbly in a lady's
chamber, to the lascivious pleasing of a lute;
that is to say, he was talking trifles to Tora
Smith, with apparent enjoyment, forgetful of
his mission, ignoring the powers of darkness
around. No light-spreading saying, no swordflash
had come from him all the evening. He
was fiddling while Rome was&mdash;waiting for the
burning it needed so badly.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a woebegone look about the
Doctor that made Philip Hume take the chair
next him after dinner, while Dale was, still as
if in play, emitting anarchist sparks for the
Colonel's entertainment.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," asked the Doctor in low,
half-angry tones, "that he thinks these people
are any good&mdash;that they are sincere or thorough
in the matter? He's wasting his time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear fellow, we must all
dine, whatever our opinions."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; we must dine, while the world
starves."</p>

<p>"The bow can't be always stretched," said
Philip, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>"You don't think, Hume, do you, that he's
getting any less&mdash;less in earnest, you know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he wrote a scorcher this very morning."</p>

<p>"Did he? That's good news. Where is it
to appear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He didn't write it on commission."</p>

<p>"His poems have such magnificent restlessness,
haven't they? I can't bear to see him
idle."</p>

<p>"Poor Dale! You must give him some holidays.
He likes pleasure like the rest of us."</p>

<p>The Doctor sighed impatiently, and Philip
looking at him anxiously, laid a hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Roberts," he said, "there is no need that
you should be ground to powder."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I hope you never will. Your wife doesn't
look very strong. Why don't you give her a
change?"</p>

<p>"A change? How am I to afford a change?
Besides, who wants a change? What change
do most workers get?"</p>

<p>"Hang most workers! Your wife wants a
change."</p>

<p>"I haven't got the money, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Then there's an end of it."</p>

<p>The Colonel rose, and they made for the
drawing room.</p>

<p>Philip detained his companion for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the Doctor, feeling the touch
on his arm.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, old fellow, go slow," said
Philip, pressing his arm, and looking at him
with an appealing smile.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>"To a Pretty Saint."</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">When Mrs. Delane came back from
London, she was met with a question
of the precise kind on which she felt
herself to be no mean authority. It
was a problem of propriety, of etiquette, and of
the usages of society, and Mrs. Delane attacked
it with a due sense of its importance and with
the pleasure of an expert. It arose out of Dale
Bannister's call at the Grange. Dale had been
accustomed, when a lady found favor in his
eyes, to inform her of the gratifying news
through the medium of a set of verses, more or
less enthusiastic and rhapsodic in their nature.
The impulse to follow his usual practice was
strong on him after meeting Janet Delane, and
issued in the composition of that poem called
"To a Pretty Saint," the title of which Nellie
had seen. He copied it out fair, and was about
to put it in the post when a thought suddenly
struck him. Miss Delane was not quite like
most of his acquaintances. It was perhaps
possible that she might think his action premature,
or even impertinent, and that she might
deem it incumbent on her to resent being called
either a saint or pretty by a friend of one interview's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
standing. Dale was divided between his
newborn doubt of his own instinct of what was
permissible and his great reluctance to doom
his work to suppression. He decided to consult
Philip Hume, who was, as he knew, more
habituated to the social atmosphere of places
like Denshire.</p>

<p>"Eh? what?" said Philip, who was busily
engaged in writing a newspaper article.
"Written a poem to a girl? All right. I'll
listen presently."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to listen. I want your
advice as to whether to send it or not."</p>

<p>"If you've wasted your time writing the
thing,&mdash;by the way, take care the Doctor doesn't
hear of it,&mdash;you may as well send it."</p>

<p>"The question is, whether she'll be
offended."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it isn't more important, because
I'm busy."</p>

<p>"Look here! Stop that anonymous stabber
of yours and listen. It's to Miss Delane."</p>

<p>Philip stopped in the middle of a particularly
vicious paragraph of the "stabber," and looked
up with amusement on his face.</p>

<p>"It's a perfectly&mdash;you know&mdash;suitable poem,"
pursued Dale. "The only question is, will she
think it a liberty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, send it. They like getting 'em;" and
Philip took up his pen again.</p>

<p>"You don't know the sort of girl she is."</p>

<p>"Then what the deuce is the good of asking
me? Ask Nellie."</p>

<p>"No, I shan't," said Dale shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus thrown, by his friend's indifference, on
his own judgment, Dale made up his mind to
send the verses,&mdash;he could not deny himself the
pleasure,&mdash;but, half alarmed at his own audacity,
which feeling was a new one in him, he
"hedged" by inclosing with them a letter of
an apologetic character. Miss Delane was not
to suppose that he took the liberty of referring
to her in the terms of his title: the little copy
of verses had merely been suggested by a remark
she made. He had failed to find an
answer on the spot. Would she pardon him
for giving his answer now in this indirect way?&mdash;and
so forth.</p>

<p>The verses, with their accompanying letter,
were received by Janet, and Janet had no doubt
of what she did feel about them, but some considerable
doubt as to what she ought to feel;
so she carried them to her mother. Mrs.
Delane put on her <i>pince-nez</i> and read the
documents in the case.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he didn't mean to be&mdash;anything
but what's nice, mamma," said Janet.</p>

<p>"I dare say not, my dear. The question is,
whether the young man knows his manners.
Let's see."</p>

<p>After careful perusal, during which Janet
watched her mother's face with some anxiety,
Mrs. Delane delivered judgment.</p>

<p>"There's no positive harm in them," she said,
"and I don't think we need take any actual
steps. Still, Janet, he is evidently to be treated
with discretion."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, mamma?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he isn't in need of encouragement, is
he? He's not backward in making friends."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. May I keep them?"</p>

<p>"Keep them? Do you want to keep
them?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly, dear," answered Janet.
"I&mdash;I thought he meant me to."</p>

<p>"No doubt. Write a civil note, dear, thank
him for letting you see them, and return them
inclosed."</p>

<p>Janet was a little reluctant to part with her
autograph manuscript,&mdash;not because of its pecuniary
value, though that was more than a
trifle, had she known, but because such things
are pleasant possessions to show to envious
friends,&mdash;but she did as she was told. She did
not, however, feel herself bound altogether to
smother her pride or to make a secret of the
tribute she had received. Tora Smith heard
the story with evident amusement, and, thinking
that others would share her appreciation of
it, relieved the somewhat uphill course of Mrs.
Hodge's call by a repetition of it: whereby it
happened that Nellie Fane came to know, not
only that Dale had written verses to Miss
Delane and sent them, but also that Miss
Delane had returned the offering. She told
Philip the latter fact, and the two ventured to
rally the poet on the occurrence. Dale took
their action very badly, and his displeasure
soon reduced Nellie to apologies. Philip was
less sensitive.</p>

<p>"D. W. T., by Jove!" he remarked. "Quite
like old times, Dale!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Dale muttered something about "infernal
chatter."</p>

<p>"You will soon be in a position to publish a
volume of 'Rejected Addresses.'"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Dale. "It's simply that
she didn't understand I meant her to keep
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's her delicate way of snubbing you,
my boy."</p>

<p>"What the deuce do you know about it, Phil?
You never wrote verses in your life. Don't you
agree with me, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"Miss Smith said Miss Delane thought she
had better not keep them."</p>

<p>"I knew that girl was a gossip directly I set
eyes on her."</p>

<p>"You're naturally hurt, old fellow, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go to the deuce! Look here, I'll bet you a
fiver she takes them back and keeps them."</p>

<p>"Done!" said Philip, and Dale seized his
hat.</p>

<p>"Why does he want her to take them?"
asked Nellie.</p>

<p>"Vanity, my dear, vanity. I suppose he's
accustomed to having his verses laid up in
lavender. Is that what you do with yours?"</p>

<p>"He never wrote me any," answered Nellie
in a tone of superlative indifference.</p>

<p>It being only two o'clock, Dale felt he could
not yet go to the Grange. He made a detour
by the town, on pretense of buying stamps;
and, the stars fighting with him, outside the
Mayor's shop he saw Janet talking to the Mayor
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Delane, miss," said the
Mayor. "Mrs. Hedger is doin' nicely. She
had a bit of feverishness about her, but Dr.
Spink's treated her wonderful."</p>

<p>"Dr. Spink? I thought you went to Dr.
Roberts?"</p>

<p>"I did, miss, but&mdash;&mdash; Well, things come
round to me, miss, being a center like."</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"Well, you may not have heard, miss, of the
things that&mdash;&mdash; Good-mornin', Mr. Bannister,
sir, good-mornin'. A fine day. Anything in
our line, sir?"</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Mayor," said Dale.
"Ah, Miss Delane, how do you do?"</p>

<p>His coming interrupted Janet's investigations
into the affairs of the Doctor, and she took her
leave of the Mayor, Dale assuming permission
to walk with her. He ought to have asked, no
doubt, thought Janet, but it would be making
too much of it to tell him so.</p>

<p>They had hardly started when he turned to her:</p>

<p>"Why did you send back my verses?"</p>

<p>"I could hardly venture to keep them, could
I?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"On so slight an acquaintance! It was very
kind of you to let me see them before they were
published."</p>

<p>"They're not going to be published."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must publish them. They're so
very pretty."</p>

<p>"Didn't you think I meant you to keep
them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should have been very conceited if I had,
shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, they were for you&mdash;not to be published.
If you don't like them, they'll be burned,
that's all."</p>

<p>Janet stole a glance at his face; he looked
like a petulant Apollo&mdash;so she thought.</p>

<p>"That would be a pity," she said gravely;
"but I don't think I ought to keep them."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Socrates is reported to have said that nothing
is reasonable which cannot be stated in a reasonable
form. Miss Janet Delane would have
dissented.</p>

<p>"Of course I like them very much. But&mdash;well,
we haven't known each other very long,
Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"You mean it was impertinent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I thought your letter perfect&mdash;I
did really. But mamma thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Dale, with brightening face.
"You would have kept them?"</p>

<p>"That's not the question," said Janet, smiling.
It was pleasant to see Apollo looking
less petulant. "But what would people say if
they heard I had poems of Mr. Dale Bannister's
about me? I should be thought a dangerous
person."</p>

<p>"I'll write some which you would like to
have."</p>

<p>"I am sure you could, if you only would.
Fancy, if you wrote really noble verses&mdash;worthy
of you!"</p>

<p>"Well, I will, if it will please you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mr. Bannister! There's no
question of pleasing me: it doesn't matter&mdash;well,
I mean, then, the great thing is to do
justice to yourself."</p>

<p>"I ought to have some encouragement in
well-doing," said Dale plaintively.</p>

<p>She shook her head with a smile, and he
went on:</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come to Littlehill and see the
house. I've improved it tremendously."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must invite mamma."</p>

<p>"Would Mrs. Delane come?"</p>

<p>This question was a little awkward, for Mrs.
Delane, after cross-examining Tora Smith
closely as to Mrs. Hodge and her daughter,
had announced that she would not go.</p>

<p>"A bachelor doesn't entertain ladies, does
he?"</p>

<p>"I should like to; and there are some
ladies&mdash;&mdash;" A sudden thought struck him, and
he stopped. He looked so pointedly at Janet
that, to her intense annoyance, she felt herself
blushing. She made the grave mistake of
changing the conversation abruptly.</p>

<p>"How did you like the Smiths?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty well."</p>

<p>"I should have thought you would have got
on tremendously well together."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I think I like people to
be one thing or the other, and the Smiths are
halfway housers."</p>

<p>"You're very ungrateful."</p>

<p>"Oh, they only asked us as a demonstration,"
said Dale, who had some acuteness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Janet laughed, but her companion was
moodily prodding the ground with his stick as
he walked along.</p>

<p>They reached a cottage where she had a
visit to pay, and she bade him good-by.</p>

<p>"Then you won't have the verses?"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, here goes;" and he took
the paper out of his pocket and tore it to bits.
The fragments fluttered to the ground.</p>

<p>"How foolish!" she said. "I dare say they
were worth a lot of money&mdash;but, then, you can
write them out again."</p>

<p>"Do you think I shall?" he asked, grinding
the fragments into the mud.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will do nothing wise," she
said, giving him her hand. Yet the extravagance
rather pleased her.</p>

<p>Until Dale reached his own house it did not
strike him that he had lost his bet. Philip
quickly reminded him, and laughed mercilessly
when a crumpled five-pound note was thrown
at his head by his angry friend.</p>

<p>"I tell you she wanted to keep them," said
Dale unjustifiably.</p>

<p>"Then why didn't she?" asked Nellie.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Delane didn't approve of it."</p>

<p>"I expect Mrs. Delane doesn't approve of
you at all," remarked Philip.</p>

<p>"No, nor of my friends either," answered
Dale, flinging himself into a chair.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Hodge, who sat
by, "her opinion will neither make us nor mar
us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"How have we had the misfortune to offend
the lady?" inquired Philip. "She has never
seen us."</p>

<p>"Here's your tea, Dale," said Nellie. "Are
you tired?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. Thanks, Nellie."</p>

<p>"Was she looking nice, Dale?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see her."</p>

<p>"I mean Miss Delane."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so. I didn't look much."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>An Indiscreet Disciple.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Summer wore away, and autumn
came in brief, calm radiance, and
passed; winter began to threaten.
At Denborough one quiet day followed
another, each one noticeable for little,
but in the aggregate producing some not unimportant
changes at Littlehill. Dale Bannister
had begun to work hard and to work in solitude;
the inspiration of Nellie's eyes seemed
either unnecessary or ineffectual. Moreover,
his leisure hours were now largely spent in
visiting at houses in the neighborhood. He
did not neglect his guests, but whenever their
engagements occupied them, instead of wandering
about alone or enjoying the humors of the
High Street, as he had been prone to do in the
early days of his sojourn, he would go over to
Mount Pleasant, or to the Grange, or to Sir
Harry Fulmer's, and he was becoming learned
in country lore and less scornful of country
ways. The Doctor was a rare visitor now, and,
when he came, it generally fell to Philip Hume's
lot to entertain him. Philip did his duty loyally,
but it was dreary work, for Roberts' conversation,
at their meetings, consisted, in the main,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of diatribes against Dale Bannister. He would
declare that Dale's conduct, in maintaining
friendly relations with the gentry of the neighborhood,
was in flagrant contradiction to the
views he had proclaimed in his writings. Philip
shrugged his shoulders, and said that some men
were better than their writings, some worse,
but no man the same as his writings; the prose
must ever be allowed for: and at this the
angry man often turned his back on the house
with an imprecation on half-heartedness. For
the rest, Philip's hands were not very full, and
he and Nellie Fane found time for long expeditions
together, which would have been more
cheerful had it not been for Nellie's scrupulous
determination to ignore the absence of the third
member of the old trio. One day Philip's idle
steps led him through the town on the search
for matter of amusement. He was caught in a
shower, and took refuge in the Mayor's shop,
knowing that his Worship always had time for
a gossip. He was not disappointed. The
Mayor entertained him with a graphic account
of the last assault on Mr. Delane's position as
member for the Denborough division, and of
his own recent re-election to his high office.
Philip congratulated him on the latter event, and
asked in curiosity:</p>

<p>"And what are your politics, Mr. Mayor?"</p>

<p>"I hold as a man in my position should have
no politics, not party politics, Mr. Hume, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, there's something to be said for that."</p>

<p>"After all, we know what they are, sir. One
out and the other in&mdash;that's what they are, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you said Mrs. Hedger canvassed for
the Squire."</p>

<p>"So she did, sir. Now, my daughter is on
the Liberal side; she and Miss Smith used to
go a-drivin' round together."</p>

<p>"A sad division of opinion, Mr. Mayor."</p>

<p>"Well, we can differ without disagreein',
sir. Besides," he added, with something like a
wink, "customers differ too."</p>

<p>"Most true."</p>

<p>"Business is business, sir, especially with a
growin' fam'ly. I always think of my fam'ly,
Mr. Hume, and how I should leave 'em if I was
took&mdash;taken."</p>

<p>"A man's first duty, Mr. Mayor."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't catch me goin' on like this
young Roberts."</p>

<p>"Why, what's he been up to now?" asked
Philip uneasily.</p>

<p>"You aint seen the <i>Standard</i>, sir?" The
Mayor, of course, meant the <i>East Denshire
Standard</i>, not the London paper of the same
name.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, last week they printed the Vicar's
sermon on 'The Work of Christianity in the
World.' A fine sermon it was, sir. I heard it,
being a Church of England man. Mrs. Hedger
goes to Chapel."</p>

<p>"'Customers differ too,'" thought Philip,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was sayin', Jones of the <i>Standard</i>
got the Vicar to give it 'im, and it came out,
with a leadin' article of Jones' crackin' it up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how does the Doctor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This week, sir," continued the Mayor, shaking
an impressive forefinger, "in the <i>Chronicle</i>&mdash;that's
the Liberal paper, sir&mdash;there's a letter
from the Doctor&mdash;two columns&mdash;just abusin'
the Church and the parsons, and the 'ole&mdash;whole
thing, fit to&mdash;well, I never did!"</p>

<p>"Hum! Rather rash, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Rash, Mr. Hume, sir? It's madness, that's
what it is, sir. He talks about 'pestilent
priests,' and I don't know what all, sir, and
ends with quotin' thirty or forty lines from a
poem called, I think, 'The Arch Apostates'&mdash;would
that be it, sir?&mdash;by Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"No! does he, by Jove?" said Philip, slapping
his thigh.</p>

<p>"And the po'try, sir, is worse than the
Doctor's own stuff, sir, beggin' your pardon as
a friend of Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"I know the lines. They're some of the
hottest he's ever done."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bannister, of course, can afford it, sir,&mdash;his
opinions are what he pleases,&mdash;but the
Doctor, sir!"</p>

<p>"So the fat's in the fire?"</p>

<p>"Just the very worst time it could ha' come
out, sir. The Guardians over at Dirkham meet
to-morrow to elect their medical officer. I'm
afraid as they won't re-elect Dr. Roberts, sir,
and there was more than one down at the
Delane Arms sayin' they'd had the last to do
with him."</p>

<p>Philip parted from his informant in much
concern for Roberts, and in no small amusement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
at the public placarding of "The Arch
Apostates." "<i>Surtout, point de zele</i>," he
could imagine Dale saying to his infatuated
disciple.</p>

<p>On returning home, however, he found the
poet saying much harder things of, if not to,
Mr. Roberts. Dale had been calling at the
Smiths'. The Colonel, while shaking his head
over Roberts' impudence, had applauded his
opinions, and was, above all, enchanted with
the extract from Dale's poem, which he had
never hitherto read. His pleasure was, as he
told Dale, greatly increased by finding that the
letter and the quotation had fallen like a bombshell
on the Grange household.</p>

<p>"The Squire was furious. Mrs. Delane said
she had no idea you had done anything so bad
as that; and little Janet sat and looked as if
someone had knocked down the Archbishop of
Canterbury. It was splendid! Gad, sir, you've
waked 'em up."</p>

<p>These congratulations had the effect of reducing
the poet almost to a frenzy. "What business,"
he demanded, "has the fellow to quote
me in support of his balderdash without my
leave?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, your works are the possession
of the nation," said Philip, smiling, as he
lit a cigar.</p>

<p>"It's an infernal liberty!" fumed Dale.</p>

<p>"You light the fire, and blame it for blazing,"
said Philip.</p>

<p>"One doesn't want to shove one's views down
people's throats."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doesn't one? One used to."</p>

<p>"I shall write and disclaim any responsibility."</p>

<p>"For the poem?"</p>

<p>"For its publication, of course."</p>

<p>"That won't do you much good."</p>

<p>The Mayor's forecast, based on a lifelong
observation of his neighbors, proved only too
correct. Dr. Spink entered the lists against
Roberts, and was elected by every vote save one.
Sir Harry Fulmer, in blind and devoted obedience
to Tora Smith, voted for Roberts; the
rest, headed by the Squire, installed his rival in
his place; and the Squire, having sternly done
his duty, sat down and wrote a long and friendly
letter of remonstrance and explanation to his
erring friend.</p>

<p>As misfortune followed misfortune, the
Doctor set his teeth, and dared fate to do her
worst. He waited a few days, hoping to be
comforted by a word of approval from his
master; none came. At last he determined to
seek out Dale Bannister, and was about to
start when his wife came in and gave him the
new issue of the <i>Chronicle</i>. Ethel Roberts was
pale and weary-looking, and she glanced anxiously
at her husband.</p>

<p>"I am going up to Littlehill," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you done your round, dear?"</p>

<p>"My round doesn't take long nowadays.
Maggs will give me fifteen pounds for the
pony: you know we don't want him now."</p>

<p>"No, Jim, and we do want fifteen pounds."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <i>Chronicle</i>, dear. There's&mdash;a letter
from Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"Is there? Good! Let's see what Bannister
has to say to these bigoted idiots."</p>

<p>He opened the paper, and in the middle of
the front page read:</p>


<p class="pn center p1 reduct">A DISCLAIMER FROM MR. BANNISTER.</p>

<p class="pq1 p1"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I desire to state that the use made by Mr.
James Roberts of my poem in your last issue was without
my authority or approbation. The poem was
written some years ago, and must not be assumed to
represent my present view on the subject of which it
treats.</p>

<p class="pf3">I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="pf4"><span class="smcap">Dale Bannister</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">The Doctor stared at the letter.</p>

<p>"Bannister&mdash;Dale Bannister wrote that!"
and he flung the paper angrily on the floor.
"Give me my hat."</p>

<p>"You're not going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, Ethel. I'm going to find out
what this means."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better wait till you're less&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Less what, Ethel? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Till the rain stops, Jim, dear; and it's just
baby's time for coming down."</p>

<p>"Hang&mdash;no, I beg your pardon, Ethel. I'm
very sorry, but I must see the end of this."</p>

<p>He rushed out, and the baby found a dull,
preoccupied, almost tearful, very unamusing
mother to play with that day.</p>

<p>The Doctor marched into Dale's room with
a stern look on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Roberts, how are you?" asked Dale,
not graciously.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Bannister?"</p>

<p>"It means, my dear fellow, that you took my
name in vain, and I had to say so."</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking of myself, though it would
have been more friendly to write to me first."</p>

<p>"Well, I was riled, and didn't think of that."</p>

<p>"But do you mean to deny your own words?"</p>

<p>"Really, Roberts, you seem to forget that I
don't enjoy setting the place by the ears,
although you seem to."</p>

<p>"You wrote that poem?"</p>

<p>"Of course I wrote the damned thing," said
Dale peevishly.</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;Bannister, you're not going to&mdash;to
throw us over?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I like to publish my views at
my own time and place, that's all."</p>

<p>"A man like you belongs to his followers as
much as to himself."</p>

<p>"More, it seems."</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at him almost scornfully.
Dale did not like scorn from anyone.</p>

<p>"I was particularly anxious," he began
apologetically, "not to get into a shindy here.
I wanted to drop politics and so on, and be
friendly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know what you're saying, or the
meanness of it?"</p>

<p>"Meanness? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You know very well. All I want to know
is if you wrote this thing?"</p>

<p>"Of course I wrote it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you stand to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think you ought to have asked me
before you did it."</p>

<p>"The Squire is shocked, eh?" asked the
Doctor, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"The Squire's views are nothing to me,"
answered Dale, flushing very red.</p>

<p>The Doctor laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Come, come, old fellow," said Dale, "don't
let us quarrel."</p>

<p>"Quarrel? Well, we won't. Only look here,
Bannister."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If you throw us over now, you'll be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, don't abuse me any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't going to abuse you. If you
leave us,&mdash;you, the leader we trusted,&mdash;where
are we, where are we?"</p>

<p>"Give me another chance," said Dale, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>"You won't withdraw this?"</p>

<p>"How the deuce can I now?"</p>

<p>The Doctor shook his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't betray us, don't betray us;" and thus
the very uncomfortable interview came to a
desired end.</p>

<p>That night at dinner Dale was cross and in
low spirits. His friends, perceiving it, forbore
to express their views as to his last public utterance,
and the repast dragged its weary length
along amid intermittent conversation.</p>

<p>When the dessert was on the table, a note
was brought for Dale. It was from the
Squire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p class="pq1 p1"><span class="smcap">Dear Bannister</span>: I was very glad to see your
letter in the <i>Chronicle</i>. Mrs. Delane joins me in hoping
you will dine with us to-morrow <i>en famille</i>. Excuse
short notice. The man waits for an answer&mdash;don't
write one.</p>

<p class="pf3">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="pf4"><span class="smcap">George Delane</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">"Say I'll come with great pleasure," said
Dale, his face growing brighter.</p>

<p>"Where will he go with great pleasure?"
asked Philip of Nellie Fane.</p>

<p>"Where is it, Dale?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only to the Grange, to dinner to-morrow.
I think I had better write a note, though&mdash;don't
you think so, Phil? More&mdash;more attentive,
you know."</p>

<p>"Write, my son," answered Philip, and, as
Dale left the room, he looked round with a
smile and exclaimed, "One!"</p>

<p>"One what, my dear?" asked Mrs. Hodge.</p>

<p>"Piece of silver, ma'am," replied Philip.</p>

<p>"You're sneering again," said Nellie in a
warning tone. "Why shouldn't he like to dine
at the Grange?" and she looked marvelously
reasonable and indifferent.</p>

<p>"I was speaking with the voice of Doctor
Roberts, Nellie, that's all. For my own part, I
think a dinner is one of those things one may
accept even from the enemy."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Dale's Own Opinion.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">If ever our own fortune would allow
us to be perfectly happy, the consumation
is prevented and spoiled by
the obstinately intruding unhappiness
of others. The reverend person who was
of opinion that the bliss of the blessed would
be increased and, so to say, vivified by the
sight of the tortures of the damned, finds
few supporters nowadays, perhaps because
our tenderer feelings shrink from such a ruthless
application of the doctrine that only by
contemplating the worse can we enjoy the
better; perhaps also because we are not so sure
as he was that we should not be the onlooked
rather than the onlookers if ever his picture
came to be realized. So sensitive are we to the
ills that others suffer that at times we feel almost
a grudge against them for their persistence&mdash;however
unwilling it be&mdash;in marring our
perfect contentment; surely they could let us
forget them for once in a way.</p>

<p>This last was Dale Bannister's frame of
mind as he lay, idly and yet not peacefully, on
his sofa next morning. This Doctor, with his
unflinching logic and unrestrained zeal, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
nuisance. His devotion had not been sought,
and certainly, if it entailed scenes like yesterday's,
was not desired. Dale never asked him
to ruin his practice, as Philip Hume said he was
doing, in order to uphold Dale's principles;
Dale did not want a starving family to his account,
whose hungry looks should press him
to a close questioning of his conscience. Any
man with an ounce of common sense would
understand that there was a time for everything,
and a place. It was one thing to publish your
views in a book, addressed to the world of
thinkers and intelligent readers; it was quite
another to brandish them in the face of your
neighbors, and explode them, like shells, in the
innocent streets of Denborough. And yet, because
he recognized this obvious distinction,
because he had some sense of what was suitable
and reasonable, and because he refused to make
enemies of people simply because they were
well off, the Doctor stormed at him as if he
were a traitor and a snob. And Philip Hume
had taken to smiling in an aggravating way
when the Grange was mentioned; and even
Nellie&mdash;&mdash; But Dale, alert as he was in his
present mood to discover matter of complaint,
found none against Nellie, unless it might be
some falling off in her old cheerfulness and
buoyancy.</p>

<p>Dale lit his pipe and set himself to consider
with impartiality whether Roberts had in fact
any grievance against him. He wanted to
satisfy himself that there was no basis for the
Doctor's indignation; his self-esteem demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
that the accusation should be disproved. But
really it was too plain. What had he done?
Refused to acquiesce in being made a fool of,
refused to meet civility with incivility, to play
the churl, to shut his eyes to intelligence and
culture and attractiveness because they happened
to be found among people who did not
think as he did or as Roberts was pleased to
think. He knew what those sneers meant, but
he would go his own way. Things had come
to a pretty pass if a man might not be civil and
seek to avoid wholly unnecessary causes of
offense without being treated as a renegade to
all his convictions. That was not his idea of
breadth of mind or toleration, or of good feeling
either. It was simple bigotry, as narrow as&mdash;aye,
narrower than&mdash;anything he at least had
found on the other side.</p>

<p>Dale disposed of this question, but he still
lay on the sofa and thought. It had been a
gain to him, he said to himself, to see this new
side of life; the expedition to Littlehill was well
justified. It is good for a man to take a flag of
truce and go talk with the enemy in the gate.
He may not change his own views,&mdash;Dale was
conscious of no change in his,&mdash;but he comes to
see how other people may hold different ones,
and the reason, or anyhow the naturalness,
of theirs. A man of Roberts' fierce Puritan
temper could not feel nor appreciate what
appealed to him so strongly in such a life as
they lived, for instance, at the Grange. It had
a beauty so its own, that unquestioned superiority,
not grasped as a prize or valued as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
opportunity, but gravely accepted as the parent
of duties&mdash;the unbroken family life, grasping
through many hands the torch undimmed from
reverend antiquity&mdash;the very house, which
seemed to enshrine honorable traditions, at
which he could not bring himself to sneer.
The sweetness of it all broke back baffled from
the wall of the Doctor's stern conviction and
iron determination. Yet how sweet it all was!
And these people welcomed into their circle any
man who had a claim to welcome, freely, ungrudgingly,
cordially. All they asked was a
little gentleness to their&mdash;he supposed they
were prejudices, a little deference to their prepossessions,
a little smoothing off of the rougher
edges of difference. It was not much to ask.
Was he churlishly to deny the small concession,
to refuse to meet them any part of the way, to
intrench himself in the dogmatic intolerance of
his most vehement utterances, to shut his mind
off from this new source of inspiration? That
was what Roberts wanted. Well, then&mdash;Roberts
be hanged!</p>

<p>The course of these reflections produced in
Dale a return to his usual equanimity. It was
plainly impossible to please everybody. He
must act as seemed right to himself, neglecting
the frowns of unreasonable grumblers. No
doubt Roberts was devoted to him, and Arthur
Angell too. Yet Roberts abused him, and
Arthur bothered him with imploring letters,
which warned him against the subtle temptations
of his new life. It was a curious sort of
devotion which showed itself mainly in criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and disapproval; it was very flattering of these
good friends to set him on a pedestal and
require him to live up to the position; only,
unfortunately, the pedestal was of their choosing,
not his. All he asked was to be allowed
to live a quiet life and work out his own ideas
in his own way. If they could not put up with
that, why&mdash;&mdash; Dale refilled his pipe and opened
a story by Maupassant.</p>

<p>It may be asserted that every man is the
victim of a particular sort of follies, the follies
engendered by his particular sort of surroundings;
they make a fool's circle within which each
of us has a foot planted; for the rest, we may
be, and no doubt generally are, very sensible
people. If we set aside Squire Delane's special
and indigenous illusions, he was very far indeed
from a fool, and after dinner that evening he
treated his distinguished guest with no small
tact. The young man was beyond question a
force; was it outside of ingenuity to turn him
in a better direction?</p>

<p>"Everybody approves of your letter," he said.
"Roberts had no business to drag your name
in."</p>

<p>"Of course one is exposed to that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"It's a penalty of greatness. But the case
is peculiar when you're actually living in the
place."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I feel. It's making me
a party in a local quarrel."</p>

<p>"That's what he wanted to do; he wanted
to fight under your shield."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't come here to fight at all."</p>

<p>"I should think not; and you haven't found
us thirsting for battle, have you?"</p>

<p>"I have found a kinder welcome than I had
any right to expect."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow! Much as we differ, we're
all proud of counting you as a Denshire man.
And I don't suppose we shall quarrel much
about Denshire affairs. Oh, I know you think
the whole system of country life an iniquity.
I don't go so deep myself. I say, there it is.
Perhaps it might be changed, but, pending
that, sensible men can work together to make
the best of it. At any rate, they can avoid
treading on one another's corns."</p>

<p>"I want to avoid everybody's corns, if they'll
avoid mine."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll try. I dare say we shall pull
together. At any rate, it's very pleasant dining
together. Shall we go upstairs and ask Janet
for a song?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane had evidently caught her cue
from her husband, and she treated Dale not as
a sinner who repenteth,&mdash;a mode of reception
which, after all, requires great tact to make it
acceptable,&mdash;but as one who had never been
a sinner at all. She asked Dale if he had been
overwhelmed by callers. He replied that he
had not suffered much in that way.</p>

<p>"I knew it," she said. "You have frightened
them, Mr. Bannister; they think you came in
search of studious retirement."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate both study and retirement, Mrs.
Delane."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I shall tell people that&mdash;may I?
Now, when I was at the Cransfords' yesterday,&mdash;he's
our Lord Lieutenant, you know,&mdash;they
were wondering whether they might call."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to see anyone."</p>

<p>"From the Mayor upward&mdash;or, I suppose,
Hedger would think I ought to say downward.
We heard what fun you made of the poor man."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bannister will be more respectful to
the Lord Lieutenant," said Janet, smiling.</p>

<p>"I suppose I disapprove of Lord Lieutenants,"
remarked Dale, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"You'll like Lady Cransford very much, and
she'll like you. She gives so many balls that
a bachelor household is a godsend."</p>

<p>"Bannister hardly depends on that for a welcome,
my dear," said the Squire from the
hearthrug.</p>

<p>"Now I declare, meeting him just as a friend
like this, I'm always forgetting that he's a
famous man."</p>

<p>"Please go on, Mrs. Delane. It's a capital
exchange. But when are you going to give me
the pleasure of seeing you at Littlehill?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane paused for just a second.</p>

<p>"I should like to visit your hermit's cell. But
I'm so busy just now, and I dare say you are.
When your guests forsake you, perhaps we will
come and relieve your solitude. Janet, will you
give us some music?"</p>

<p>Dale followed Janet to the piano, with a little
frown on his brow. Why wouldn't she come
now? Was it&mdash;&mdash; Janet's voice dispersed the
frown and the reflection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>She sang a couple of songs, choosing them
out of a book. As she turned over the leaves,
Dale saw that some of the airs were set to
words of his own writing. When Janet came
to one of these, she turned the leaf hastily.
The Squire had gone out, and Mrs. Delane,
with the privilege of near relationship, was
absorbed in a novel.</p>

<p>"Will you do me a great favor?" he said.</p>

<p>"What, Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>"I should like to hear you sing words of
mine. See, here are two or three."</p>

<p>She glanced through them; then she shut
the book and made as though to rise.</p>

<p>"You won't do it?"</p>

<p>Janet blushed and looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Mr. Bannister; but I can't
sing those words. I&mdash;I don't like them."</p>

<p>"I am sorry they are so bad," he answered
in an offended tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, so far as power and&mdash;and
beauty goes, everything in the book is trash
compared to them. But I can't sing them."</p>

<p>"I won't press you."</p>

<p>"I know you are angry. Please don't be
angry, Mr. Bannister. I can't do what I think
wrong, can I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no right to be angry."</p>

<p>"There, you wouldn't say that unless you
were angry. People never do."</p>

<p>"You have such a wretchedly bad opinion
of me, Miss Delane."</p>

<p>"Do you mind that?"</p>

<p>"You know I do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then one would think you would try to
change it."</p>

<p>"Ah, how can I?"</p>

<p>"Write something I should delight in singing."</p>

<p>"If I do, may I dedicate it to you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that wouldn't be allowed."</p>

<p>"But if it were allowed, would you allow
it?"</p>

<p>"You know how proud any girl would be of
it&mdash;of course you know."</p>

<p>"You don't do justice to my humility."</p>

<p>"Do justice to yourself first, Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"What sort of songs do you like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anything honest, and manly, and patriotic,
and&mdash;and nice in feeling."</p>

<p>"A catholic taste&mdash;and yet none of mine
satisfy it."</p>

<p>"I will not be quarreled with," declared
Janet.</p>

<p>"My only wish is to propitiate you."</p>

<p>"Then you know now how to do it."</p>

<p>It must be allowed that conversations of this
nature have a pleasantness of their own, and
Dale left the Grange with a delightful feeling of
having been treated as he ought to be treated.
He found Philip Hume writing and smoking in
the study.</p>

<p>"Well, been stroked the right way, old
man?" asked Philip, throwing down his pen.</p>

<p>Dale helped himself to whisky and soda
water, without replying.</p>

<p>"I've been having a talk with Nellie," pursued
Philip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's wrong with Nellie?"</p>

<p>"She's got some notion in her head that she
and her mother ought to go."</p>

<p>Dale was lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>"Of course I told her it was all nonsense,
and that you meant them to stay as long as
they liked. She's got some maggot in her
head about propriety&mdash;all nonsense, when her
mother's here."</p>

<p>"I don't want them to go, if they like staying,"
said Dale.</p>

<p>"Well, we should be slow without Nellie,
shouldn't we? You must blow her up for
thinking of it. She only wants to be persuaded."</p>

<p>"She can do as she likes."</p>

<p>"You don't seem very enthusiastic about it,
one way or the other."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Phil, I can't be expected to
cry at the idea of little Nellie Fane leaving us."</p>

<p>"Yet you made rather a point of her coming&mdash;but
that was two months ago."</p>

<p>"Really, you might leave Nellie and me to
settle it."</p>

<p>"What I told her was right, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't suppose I wanted you to
tell her to pack up?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you want, old man,"
said Philip; "and I doubt if you do."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Prejudiced Verdict.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">It has been contumeliously said by
insolent Englishmen&mdash;a part of our
population which may sometimes
seem to foreign eyes as large as the
whole&mdash;that you might put any other of the
world's capitals, say Paris or New York, down
in London, and your cabman would not be
able to find it. However this may be,&mdash;and
there is no need in this place either for assertions
or admissions,&mdash;it is certain that you
might unload a wagonful of talents in Piccadilly,
and they would speedily be absorbed and
leave little obvious trace of the new ingredient.
Hence the advantage, for a man who does
not dislike the <i>digito monstrari et dicier</i> "<i>hic
est</i>," of dwelling in small places, and hence, a
cynic might suggest, the craving for quieter
quarters displayed by some of our less conspicuous
celebrities. It is better, says a certain
authority, to reign in hell than serve in heaven;
and a man may grow weary of walking
unrecognized down the Strand, when he has
only, to be the beheld of all beholders, to take
up his residence in&mdash;perhaps it will be more
prudent to say Market Denborough, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
point the finger of printed scorn at any better
known resort.</p>

<p>This very ungenerous explanation was the
one which Miss Victoria Smith chose to adopt
as accounting for Dale Bannister's coming to
Littlehill. Such an idea had never crossed her
mind at first, but it became evident that a man
who could leave his friend in the lurch and
palter with his principles, as Dale's letter to the
<i>Chronicle</i> showed him to be doing, could only
be credited with any discoverable motive less
bad and contemptible than the worst through
mere hastiness and ill-considered good nature.
For her part, she liked a man to stick to his
colors and to his friends, and not be ashamed
before the tea tables of Denshire. No, she had
never read his poems, she had no time, but
papa had, and agreed with every word of them.</p>

<p>"Gad! does he?" said Sir Harry Fulmer, to
whom these views were expressed. "Well
played the Colonel!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, some of them made me sit up rather,"
remarked Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, anything would make you 'sit up,' as
you call it. I don't consider you a Radical."</p>

<p>"I voted for your friend the Doctor anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was good of you. You were the
only one with an elementary sense of justice."</p>

<p>Sir Harry's sense of justice, elementary or
other, had had very little to do with his vote,
but he said with honest pride:</p>

<p>"Somebody ought to stand by a fellow when
he's down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Especially when he's in the right."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't quite see, Miss Smith, what
business it was of Roberts' to cut up the
Vicar's sermon. Naturally the Vicar don't
like it."</p>

<p>"So he takes his medicine from Dr. Spink!"</p>

<p>"Rather awkward for him to have Roberts
about the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you defend him."</p>

<p>"The Vicar's a very good fellow, though he's
a Tory."</p>

<p>"You seem to think all Tories good fellows."</p>

<p>"So they are, most of them."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think Mr. Bannister's right
too?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be so down on him as you are."</p>

<p>"You like people who lead their friends on
and then forsake them?"</p>

<p>"Bannister never asked him to write the
letter."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not my idea of friendship. I
wouldn't have a friend who thought that conduct
right."</p>

<p>"Then I think it deuced wrong," said Sir
Harry promptly.</p>

<p>"It's no compliment to a woman to treat her
like a baby," remarked Tora with dignity.</p>

<p>Sir Harry perceived that it would be to his
advantage to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Are you going skating?" he asked.
"There's nothing else to do in this beastly
frost."</p>

<p>"Does the ice bear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they're skating on the Grange lake. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
met Hume, Bannister's friend, and he told me
Bannister was there."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he going? I rather like him."</p>

<p>"No, he was walking with Miss Fane. I
believe I rather put my foot in it by asking her
if she wasn't going."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"She said she didn't know Mrs. Delane, and
looked confused, don't you know."</p>

<p>"Hasn't Mrs. Delane called?"</p>

<p>"It seems not," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long they are going to stay
at Littlehill?"</p>

<p>"Forever, apparently. Shall you come to
the lake?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps in the afternoon."</p>

<p>Tora returned to the house, still wondering.
She was very angry with Dale, and prepared to
think no good of him. Was it possible that
she and the Colonel had been hasty in stretching
out the hand of welcome to Mrs. Hodge
and her daughter? For all her independence,
Tora liked to have Mrs. Delane's <i>imprimatur</i>
on the women of her acquaintance. She
thought she would have a word with the Colonel,
and went to seek him in his study. He
was not there, but it chanced that there lay on
the table a copy of Dale's first published volume,
"The Clarion." Three-quarters of the
little book were occupied with verses on matters
of a more or less public description&mdash;beliefs
past and future, revolutions effected and prayed
for, and so forth; the leaves bore marks of use,
and evidently were often turned by the Colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
But bound up with them was a little sheaf of
verses of an amatory character: where these
began, the Colonel's interest appeared to cease,
for the pages were uncut; he had only got as
far as the title. It was not so with his daughter.
Having an idle hour and some interest in the
matters and affairs of love, she took a paper-knife
and sat down to read. Poets are, by
ancient privilege, <i>legibus soluti</i>, and Dale certainly
reveled in his freedom. Still, perhaps,
the verses were not in reality so very, very
atrocious as they unhappily appeared to the
young lady who now read them. Tora was
accustomed to consider herself almost a revolutionary
spirit, and her neighbors, half in earnest,
half in joke, encouraged the idea; but
her revolutions were to be very strictly confined,
and the limits of her free-thought were marked
out by most unyielding metes and bounds&mdash;bounds
that stopped very short at the church
door and on the domestic threshold. This
frame of mind is too common to excite comment,
and it had been intensified in her by the
social surroundings against which she was in
mock revolt. Dale's freedom knew no trammels,
or had known none when he wrote "The
Clarion"; nothing was sacred to him except
truth, everything as nothing beside reason, reason
the handmaid of passion, wherein the spirit
and individuality of each man found their rightful
expression. This theory, embodied in a poet's
fancy and enlivened by a young man's ardor,
made fine verses, but verses which startled Tora
Smith. She read for half an hour, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
flinging the book down and drawing a long
breath, exclaimed: "I can believe anything of
him now!"</p>

<p>And she had had this man to dinner! And
that girl! Who was that girl?</p>

<p>The Colonel came home to luncheon in very
good spirits. He had just succeeded, in the
interests of freedom, in stirring up a spirit of
active revolt in Alderman Johnstone. The
Alderman had hitherto, like his father before
him, occupied his extensive premises on a
weekly tenancy; he had never been threatened
with molestation or eviction; but he felt that he
existed on sufferance, and the consciousness of
his precarious position had been irksome to him.
A moment had come when the demand for
houses was slack, when two or three were
empty, and when the building trade itself was
nearly at a standstill. The Colonel had incited
Johnstone to seize the opportunity to ask from
the Squire a lease, and Johnstone had promised
to take nothing less than "seven, fourteen, or
twenty-one." If refused, he declared he would
surrender the premises and build for himself
on some land of the Colonel's just outside the
town.</p>

<p>"Delane must grant it," said the Colonel,
rubbing his hands, "and then we shall have one
house anyhow where our bills can be put up.
Bannister will be delighted. By the way, Tora,
he wants us to go in to tea to-day, after skating.
I suppose you're going to skate?"</p>

<p>"I am going to skate, but I am not going to
Mr. Bannister's," said Tora coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>The Colonel was told why not with explicitness
and vehemence. He tugged his white whisker
in some perplexity: he did not mind much
about the poems, though, of course, no excess
of scrupulousness could be too great in a girl
like Tora; but if she were right about the
other affair! That must be looked into.</p>

<p>The Colonel was one of those people who
pride themselves on tact and <i>savoir faire</i>; he
aggravated this fault by believing that tact
and candor could be combined in a happy
union, and he determined to try the effect of
the mixture on Dale Bannister. It would go
hard if he did not destroy this mare's nest of
Tora's.</p>

<p>All the neighborhood was skating on the
Grange lake under a winter sun, whose ruddy
rays tinged the naked trees, and drew an answering
glitter from the diamond-paned windows
of the house. The reeds were motionless,
and the graze of skaters on the ice sounded
sharp in the still air, and struck the ear through
the swishing of birch brooms and the shuffle of
sweepers' feet. From time to time a sudden
thud and a peal of laughter following told of
disaster, or there grated across the lake a chair,
carrying one who preferred the conquest of
men to the science of equilibrium. Rosy cheeks
glowed, nimble feet sped, and lissom figures
swayed to and fro as they glided over the shining
surface, till even the old and the stout, the
cripples and the fox hunters, felt the glow of
life tingling in their veins, and the beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the world feeding their spirits with fresh desire.
"It is not all of life to live," but, at such a
moment, it is the best part of it.</p>

<p>Dale Bannister was enjoying himself; he was
a good skater, and it gave him pleasure that,
when people turned to look at the famous poet,
they should see an athletic youth: only he
wished that Janet Delane would give him an
opportunity of offering his escort, and not appear
so contented with the company of a tall
man of military bearing, who had come down
to the water with the Grange party. He was
told that the newcomer was Captain Ripley,
Lord Cransford's eldest son, and he did not
escape without witnessing some of the nods and
becks which, in the country, where everybody
knows everybody, accompany the most incipient
stages of a supposed love affair. Feeling,
under these circumstances, a little desolate, for
Philip was engrossed in figures and would not
waste his time talking, he saw with pleasure
Tora Smith and Sir Harry coming toward him.
He went to meet them, and, at a distance of a
few yards from them, slackened his pace and
lifted his hat, not doubting of friendly recognition.
Sir Harry returned his salute with a
cheery "How are you?" but did not stop, for
Tora swept on past Dale Bannister, without a
glance at him. In surprise, he paused. "She
must have seen me," he thought, "but why in
the world&mdash;&mdash;" Bent on being sure, he put
himself right in her path as she completed the
circle and met him again. There was no mistaking
her intention; she gave him the cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
direct, as clearly and as resolutely as ever it
was given.</p>

<p>Sir Harry had remonstrated in vain. In
Tora's uncompromising mind impulse did not
wait on counsel, and her peremptory "I have
my reasons" refused all information and prevented
all persuasion. He felt he had done
enough for friendship when he braved her
disapproval by declining to follow her example.
He did not pretend to understand the ways of
women, and Dale Bannister might fight his
own battles.</p>

<p>While Dale was yet standing in angry bewilderment,&mdash;for
who had received him with
more cordiality than she who now openly
insulted him?&mdash;he saw the Colonel hobbling
toward him across the slippery expanse. The
Colonel fell once, and Dale heard him swear
testily at the sweeper who helped him to rise.
He thought it kind to meet him halfway; perhaps
the Colonel would explain. The Colonel
was most ready to do so; in fact, he had come
for the very purpose of warning Bannister that
some silly idea was afloat, which it only needed
a word to scatter.</p>

<p>"Is there?" said Dale. "Possibly that is
why Miss Smith failed to see me twice just
now?"</p>

<p>"Your poems have shocked her, my boy,"
said the Colonel, with a knowing look&mdash;the
look that represented tact and <i>savoir
faire</i>.</p>

<p>"Is that all? She takes rather severe measures,
doesn't she?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," answered the Colonel, with the smile
which brought candor into play, "that isn't
quite all."</p>

<p>"What in the world else is there?"</p>

<p>"You know how censorious people are, and
how a girl takes alarm at the very idea of
anything&mdash;you know?"</p>

<p>Dale chafed at these diplomatic approaches.</p>

<p>"If there's anything said against me, pray
let me know."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing very definite," said the
Colonel uneasily. He did not find what he had
to say so simple as it had seemed.</p>

<p>"Indefinite things are most hopeless."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, quite so. Well, if you really wish
it&mdash;if you won't be offended. No doubt it's all
a mistake."</p>

<p>"What do they say?"</p>

<p>"Well, we're men of the world, Bannister.
The fact is, people don't quite understand
your&mdash;your household."</p>

<p>"My household It consists of myself alone
and the servants."</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear fellow, of course! I
knew it was so, but I am glad to be able to say
so on your own authority."</p>

<p>The aim of speech is, after all, only to convey
ideas; the Colonel had managed, however
clumsily, to convey his idea. Dale frowned,
and pretended to laugh.</p>

<p>"How absurd!" he said. "I should resent
it if it were not too absurd."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, Bannister, you'll acquit me of any
meddling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'm sorry my guests have given
rise, however innocently, to such talk."</p>

<p>"It's most unfortunate. I'm sure nothing
more is needed. I hope the ladies are well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks."</p>

<p>"I don't see them here."</p>

<p>"No, they're not here," answered Dale,
frowning again.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall see some more of them?"</p>

<p>"You're very kind. I&mdash;I don't suppose they&mdash;will
be staying much longer."</p>

<p>As Dale made his way to the bank to take
off his skates, Janet and Tora passed him together.
Tora kept her eyes rigidly fixed on the
chimneys of the Grange. He made no sign of
expecting recognition, but Janet, as she drew
near, looked at him, blushing red, and bowed
and smiled.</p>

<p>"That girl's a trump," said Dale Bannister.
"She sticks to her friends."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Fable about Birds.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Mrs. Hodge and Nellie, being left to
their own resources, had employed the
afternoon in paying a visit to Ethel
Roberts, and nothing was wanting to
fill Dale's cup of vexation to overflowing, unless
it were to have Nellie flying open-mouthed at
him, as he grumblingly expressed it, with a tale
of the distress in the Doctor's household.
Ethel Roberts had the fortitude to bear her
troubles, the added fortitude to bear them
cheerfully, but not the supreme fortitude which
refuses to tell a tale of woe to any ear, however
sympathetic. She did not volunteer information,
but she did allow it to be dragged out of
her, and the barriers of her reserve broke down
before Mrs. Hodge's homely consolations and
Nellie's sorrowful horror. They were reduced,
she admitted, in effect to living on little else
than her own wretched income; the practice
brought in hardly more than it took out, for,
while the rich patients failed, the poor remained;
the rent was overdue, bills were unpaid, and
the butcher, the milkman, and the coal merchant
were growing sulky.</p>

<p>"And while," said Mrs. Hodge, "that poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
young creature is pinching, and starving, and
crying, the man's thinking of nothing but
Nihilists and what not. I'd Nihilist him!"</p>

<p>Dinner was served to Dale with sauce of this
sort.</p>

<p>"Can I prevent fools suffering for their folly?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"The baby looks so ill," said Nellie, "and
Mrs. Roberts is worn to a shadow."</p>

<p>"Did you see Roberts?" asked Philip.</p>

<p>"For a minute," said Nellie, "but he was
very cold and disagreeable."</p>

<p>"Thought you were tarred with the same
brush as Dale, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Can't you do anything for 'em, Dale?" asked
Mrs. Hodge.</p>

<p>"I can send him a check."</p>

<p>"He'll send it back," remarked Philip.</p>

<p>"I wish he'd get out of the place."</p>

<p>"Yes, he might as well be miserable somewhere
else, mightn't he?"</p>

<p>Dale glared at his friend, and relapsed into
silence. Nevertheless, in spite of Philip's prediction,
he sat down after dinner and wrote to
Roberts, saying that he had heard that he was
in temporary embarrassment, and urging him
to allow Dale to be his banker for the moment;
this would, Dale added, be the best way of
showing that he bore no malice for Dale's letter.
He sent a man with the note, ordering him to
wait for an answer.</p>

<p>The answer was not long in coming; the
man was back in half an hour, bringing the
Doctor's reply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p class="pq1 p1">Three months ago I should have thought it an
honor to share my last crust with you, and no shame to
ask half of all you had. Now I will not touch a farthing
of your money until you come back to us. If your
friends pay my wife further visits, I shall be obliged if
they will look somewhat less keenly at my household
arrangements.</p>

<p class="pf4"><span class="smcap">James Roberts.</span></p>

<p class="p1">"There is the snub you have brought on
me!" exclaimed Dale angrily, flinging the letter
to Nellie. "I might have known better than to
listen to your stories."</p>

<p>"Dale, Dale, it was every word true. How
selfish he is not to think of his wife!"</p>

<p>"Many people are selfish."</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter, Dale?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm infernally worried. I never get any
peace."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you a good time skating?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm beginning to hate this place."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dale, I've enjoyed my visit so much!"</p>

<p>"Very glad to hear it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"You must have seen it; we've stayed so
long. I've often told mamma we ought to be
going."</p>

<p>Dale lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Indeed we have had no mercy on you,
Dale; but the country and the rest are so
delightful."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;in some ways."</p>

<p>"But I must be back at work. Mamma
thought next Saturday would do."</p>

<p>"As soon as that?" said Dale, with polite
surprise.</p>

<p>"Think how long we have been here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't go on Saturday!"</p>

<p>Nellie's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Don't you want us to?" she asked, with an
eager little smile. Dale was going to be kind
after all.</p>

<p>"No. Why shouldn't you stay till Monday?"</p>

<p>The face fell, the smile disappeared; but she
answered, saving her self-respect:</p>

<p>"Saturday is more convenient for&mdash;for arriving
in town. I think we had better fix Saturday,
Dale."</p>

<p>"As you like. Sorry to lose you, Nell."</p>

<p>He sauntered off to the smoking room to join
Philip. When Philip came into the drawing
room half an hour later in search of a book, he
found Nellie sitting before the fire. He took
his stand on the hearthrug, and looked steadily
down on her.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," he said, "there was
a very beautiful bird who, as it chanced, grew
up with a lot of crows. For a long while he
liked the crows, and the crows liked him&mdash;very
much, some of them. Both he and the crows
were pleased when the eagles and all the swell
birds admired him, and said nice things about
him, and wanted to know him&mdash;and the crows
who liked him most were most pleased. Presently
he did come to know the eagles and the
other swell birds, and he liked them very
much, and he began to get a little tired of
the old crows, and by and by he left their
company a good deal. He was a polite bird
and a kind bird, and never told them that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
didn't want them any more. But they saw he
didn't."</p>

<p>There was a little sob from the armchair.</p>

<p>"Whereupon some of them broke their
hearts, and others&mdash;didn't. The others were
wisest, Nellie."</p>

<p>He paused, gazing down at the distressful
little heap of crumpled drapery and roughened
gleaming hair.</p>

<p>"Much wisest. He was not a bad bird as
birds go&mdash;but not a bird to break one's heart
about, Nellie: what bird is?"</p>

<p>There was another sob. Philip looked despairingly
at the ceiling and exclaimed under
his breath:</p>

<p>"I wish to God she wouldn't cry!"</p>

<p>He took his book from the mantelpiece where
he had laid it and moved toward the door.
But he came back again, unable to leave her
like that, and walked restlessly about the room,
stopping every now and then to stand over her,
and wonder what he could do.</p>

<p>Presently he took a feverish little hand in his,
and pressed it as it lay limp there.</p>

<p>"The old crows stood by one another, Nellie,"
he said, and he thought he felt a sudden grip
of his hand, coming and timidly in an instant
going.</p>

<p>It seemed to comfort her to hold his hand.
The sobs ceased, and presently she looked up
and said, with a smile:</p>

<p>"I always used to cry at going back to
school."</p>

<p>"Going back to work," said Philip, "is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the few things in the world really worth crying
about."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it?" she said, unblushingly
availing herself of the shelter of his affected
cynicism. She was afraid he might go on talking
about crows, a topic which had been all
very well, and even a little comforting, when
she was hidden among the cushions, but would
not do now.</p>

<p>"And London is so horrid in winter," she
continued. "Are you going back soon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall wait a little and look after
Dale."</p>

<p>"Dale never tells one what is happening."</p>

<p>"I'll keep you posted, in case there's a
revolution in Denborough, or anything of that
sort."</p>

<p>A step was heard outside. With a sudden
bound Nellie reached the piano, sat down, and
began to play a lively air. Dale came in, looking
suspiciously at the pair.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd gone to bed, Nellie."</p>

<p>"Just going. Mr. Hume and I have been
talking."</p>

<p>"About the affairs of the nation," said Philip.</p>

<p>"But I'm off now. Good-night, Dale."</p>

<p>Dale looked closely at her.</p>

<p>"What are your eyes red for? Have you
been crying?"</p>

<p>"<i>Crying</i>, Dale? What nonsense! I've
been roasting them before the fire, that's all;
and if they are red, it's not polite to say so, is
it, Mr. Hume?"</p>

<p>"Rightly understood, criticism is a compliment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
as the reviewers say when they slate you,"
remarked Philip. "He might not have noticed
your eyes at all."</p>

<p>"Inconceivable," said Dale politely, for he
was feeling very kindly disposed to this pretty
girl, who came when he wanted her, and went
when&mdash;well, after a reasonably long visit.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Dale. I'm so sorry about&mdash;Mr.
Roberts, you know."</p>

<p>Dale, having no further use for this grievance,
was graciously pleased to let it be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't know he'd be such a brute.
Good-night, Nellie."</p>

<p>The two men returned to the smoking room.
Philip, looking for a piece of paper wherewith
to light his pipe, happened to notice a little
bundle of proof-sheets lying on the table.</p>

<p>"Ah, the spring bubbling again?" he asked.</p>

<p>Dale nodded.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, how are the rest of us to
get our masterpieces noticed? You are a
monopolist."</p>

<p>"It's only a little volume."</p>

<p>"What's it about? May I look?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you like," answered Dale carelessly;
but he kept his eye on his friend.</p>

<p>Philip took up the first sheet, and read the
title-page; he smiled, and, turning over, came
to the dedication.</p>

<p>"You call it 'Amor Patriæ?'"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you like the title?"</p>

<p>"Hum! There was no thought of pleasing
me when it was christened, I presume. And
you dedicate it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, is that there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's there&mdash;'<i>To her that shall be
named hereafter.</i>'"</p>

<p>Dale poked the fire before he answered.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that's the dedication."</p>

<p>"So I see. Well, I hope she'll like them.
It is an enviable privilege to confer immortality."</p>

<p>"I'll confer it on you, if you like."</p>

<p>"Yes, do. It will be less trouble than getting
it for myself."</p>

<p>"Under the title of 'The Snarler.'"</p>

<p>Philip stood on the hearthrug and warmed
himself.</p>

<p>"My dear Dale," he said, "I do not snarl.
A wise author pleases each section of the public
in turn. Hitherto you have pleased me and
my kind, and Roberts and his kind, and Arthur
Angell and his kind&mdash;who are, by the way, not
worth pleasing, for they expect presentation
copies. Now, in this new work, which is, I
understand, your tribute to the nation which
has the honor to bear you, you will please&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused.</p>

<p>"I always write to please myself," said
Dale.</p>

<p>"Yourself," continued Philip, "this mysterious
lady, and, I think we may add, the Mayor
of Market Denborough."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" said the poet.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Dedication&mdash;and a Desecration.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">A few weeks later the Mayor stood
at his door, one bright morning in
January, holding a parley with Alderman
Johnstone.</p>

<p>"I dessay, now," said the Mayor, "that you
aint been in the way of seein' the Squire
lately?"</p>

<p>"I see him last when he signed my lease,"
answered the Alderman, with a grim smile,
"and that's a month come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I had a conversation with him yesterday,
and after touchin' on the matter of that last
pavin' contract,&mdash;he'd heard o' your son-in-law
gettin' it, Johnstone,&mdash;he got talkin' about Mr.
Bannister."</p>

<p>"Aye? did he?"</p>

<p>"And about his noo book. 'It's a blessin','
he says, 'to see a young man of such promise
shakin' himself free of that pestilential
trash.' He meant your opinions by that, Johnstone."</p>

<p>"Supposing 'e did, what then? I don't label
my opinions to please the customers like as
some do their physic."</p>

<p>The Mayor was not in a fighting mood; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
mind was busy with speculations, and he
ignored the challenge.</p>

<p>"Queer start Mr. Bannister showin' up at the
church bazaar, eh? Spent a heap o' money,
too. I met Mr. Hume, and asked him about it,
and he said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wan't no business o' yours, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hume&mdash;he's a gentleman, Johnstone,"
remarked the Mayor in grave rebuke.</p>

<p>"Well, what did 'e say?"</p>

<p>"That where the carcass was, the eagles 'ud
be gathered together."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnstone smiled a smile of pity for the
Mayor's density.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you suppose he meant?"
asked the Mayor in reply to the smile.</p>

<p>"Where the gells is, the lads is," said the
Alderman, with a wink, as he passed on his
way.</p>

<p>This most natural, reasonable, and charitable
explanation of Dale's conduct in identifying
himself with the Vicar's pastoral labors had,
oddly enough, suggested itself to no one else,
unless it might be to Captain Gerard Ripley.
His presence had been hailed on the one side,
and anathematized on the other, as an outward
sign of an inward conversion, and his lavish
expenditure had been set down to a repentant
spirit rather than a desire to gratify any particular
stall-holder. The Vicar had just read
"Amor Patriæ," and he remarked to everyone
he met that the transition from an appreciation
of the national greatness to an adhesion to the
national church was but a short step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Unhappily, in a moment of absence, he
chanced to say so to Colonel Smith, who was
at the bazaar for the purpose of demonstrating
his indifferent impartiality toward all religious
sects.</p>

<p>"You might as well say," answered the
Colonel in scorn, "that because a man stands
by the regiment he's bound to be thick with
the chaplain."</p>

<p>Captain Ripley alone, with the penetration
born of jealousy, attributed Dale's presence
simply and solely to the same motive as had
produced his own, to wit, a desire to be where
Miss Delane was. The Captain was a little
sore; he had known Janet from childhood, they
had exchanged many children's vows, and when
he was sixteen and she thirteen she had
accepted a Twelfth Night cake ring from him.
The flirtation had always proceeded in its
gentle, ambling course, and the Captain had
returned on long leave with the idea that it was
time to put the natural termination in the way
of being reached. Janet disappointed him; she
ridiculed his tender references to bygone days,
characterizing what had passed as boy-and-girl
nonsense, and perseveringly kept their intercourse
on a dull level of friendliness. On the
other hand, whatever might be the nature of
her acquaintance with Dale Bannister, it was at
least clear that it was marked by no such
uneventful monotony. Sometimes she would
hardly speak to him; at others she cared to
speak to no one else. The Captain would have
profited ill by the opportunities a residence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
garrison towns offers if he had not recognized
that these changeful relations were fraught with
peril to his hopes.</p>

<p>At the bazaar, for example, he was so much
moved by a long conversation between Janet
and Dale, which took place over the handing of
a cup of tea, that he unburdened himself to his
friend Sir Harry Fulmer. Now Sir Harry was
in a bad temper; he had his object in attending
as the Captain had, and Colonel Smith had just
told him that Tora was not coming.</p>

<p>"Who is the fellow?" demanded Captain
Ripley.</p>

<p>"Writes poetry."</p>

<p>"I never heard of him."</p>

<p>"I dare say not. It's not much in your line,
is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's a queer-looking beggar."</p>

<p>"Think so? Now I call him a good-looking
chap."</p>

<p>"Why the deuce doesn't he get his hair
cut?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Perhaps Janet Delane likes it
long."</p>

<p>"I hate that sort of fellow, Harry."</p>

<p>"He's not a bad chap."</p>

<p>"Does the Squire like him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and I don't care. How
beastly hot this room is! I shall go."</p>

<p>"I say, Harry, I've only just come back, you
know. Is there anything on?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you want to take a hand, I should
cut in pretty sharp," said Sir Harry, elbowing
his way to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Ripley, impatiently refusing to buy a
negro doll which the Vicar's daughter pressed
on his favorable notice, leaned against the wall
and grimly regarded Dale Bannister.</p>

<p>The latter was just saying:</p>

<p>"Have you looked at the verses at all, Miss
Delane?"</p>

<p>"I have read every one, over and over. They
are splendid."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm new to that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's so&mdash;such a joy to me to see
you doing what is really worthy of you."</p>

<p>"If there is any credit, it's yours."</p>

<p>"Now why do you say that? It isn't true,
and it just spoils it."</p>

<p>"Spoils it?" said Dale, who thought girls
liked compliments.</p>

<p>"Yes. If you had really only done it to
please&mdash;an individual, it would be worth nothing.
You couldn't help doing it. I knew you
couldn't."</p>

<p>"At any rate, you must accept the responsibility
of having put it into my head."</p>

<p>"Not even that, Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's the meaning of the dedication."</p>

<p>No one is quite free from guile. Janet
answered:</p>

<p>"The dedication is rather mysterious, Mr.
Bannister."</p>

<p>"I meant it to be so to all the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you?"</p>

<p>"Except you."</p>

<p>Janet blushed and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," pursued Dale, "if I shall ever
be allowed to name that lady?"</p>

<p>"That will depend on whether she wishes
it."</p>

<p>"Of course. Do you think she will&mdash;hereafter?"</p>

<p>"Won't you have another cup? It's only
half a crown."</p>

<p>"Yes, two more, please. Do you think she
will?"</p>

<p>"How thirsty you seem to be!"</p>

<p>"Will she?"</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Bannister, I mustn't neglect all
my customers. See, Mrs. Gilkison is selling
nothing."</p>

<p>"But will she?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;unless you go and buy something
from Mrs. Gilkison."</p>

<p>Now whether Janet were really concerned for
Mrs. Gilkison, or whether she had caught sight
of Captain Ripley's lowering countenance, or
whether she merely desired to avoid pledging
herself to Dale, it is immaterial, and also impossible
to say. Dale felt himself dismissed,
with the consolation of perceiving that his dedication
had not been unfavorably received in the
quarter to which it was addressed.</p>

<p>Accordingly it was in a cheerful frame of
mind that he set out for home, scattering most
of his purchases among the children before he
went.</p>

<p>He was in a kindly mood, and when he saw
James Roberts coming up High Street, he did
not, as he had once or twice lately, cross the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
road to avoid meeting him, but held on his path,
determined to offer a friendly greeting.</p>

<p>When the Doctor came up, he stopped and
took from his breast pocket the little green
volume which contained Dale's latest poems.
He held it up before the author's eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, Roberts, I see you have the new work.
How do you like it?"</p>

<p>He tried to speak easily, but the Doctor did
not appear to be in a conciliatory temper.</p>

<p>"Are these things really yours?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course they are."</p>

<p>"This wretched jingo doggerel yours?"</p>

<p>Dale felt this unjust. The verses might not
express the Doctor's views, but an immortal
poet's works are not lightly to be called
doggerel.</p>

<p>"What a narrow-minded beggar you are!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The Doctor answered nothing. Buttoning
up his threadbare coat, so as to leave his arms
free, with an effort he tore the leaves from their
cover, rent them across, flung them on the road,
and trod them into the mud. Then, without a
word, he passed on his way, while Dale stood
and stared at the dishonored wreck.</p>

<p>"He's mad&mdash;stark mad!" he declared at
last. "How ill the poor chap looks, too!"</p>

<p>The Doctor hurried down the street, with a
strange malicious smile on his face. Every now
and then his hand sought his breast pocket
again, and hugged a check for a hundred
pounds which lay there. It was his last money
in the world; when that was gone, his banking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
account was exhausted, and nothing remained
but his wife's pittance&mdash;and nothing more was
coming. Yet he had devoted that sum to a
purpose, and now he stopped at Alderman
Johnstone's door, and asked for the master of
the house, still grimly smiling at the thought of
what he was preparing for Dale Bannister, if
only Johnstone would help him. Johnstone had
a lease now, he was independent&mdash;if only he
would help him!</p>

<p>The Alderman listened to the plan.</p>

<p>"It's a new trade for me," said he, with a grin.</p>

<p>"I find the stock&mdash;I have it ready. And&mdash;&mdash;"
He held up the check.</p>

<p>The Alderman's eyes glistened.</p>

<p>"They can't touch me," he said, "and I
should like to 'ave a shy at the Squire. 'Ere's
my 'and upon it."</p>

<p>A day or two afterward Dale heard that
the sale of "Sluggards" was increasing by
leaps and bounds. A single house had taken
five hundred copies. "Amor Patriæ" had evidently
given a fresh impetus to the earlier work,
in spite of the remarkable difference of tone
which existed between them.</p>

<p>"It shows," said Dale complacently to Philip
Hume, "that most people are not such intolerant
idiots as that fellow Roberts."</p>

<p>But what it really did show will appear in
due season. Dale did not know; nor did
Philip, for he said, with a fine sneer:</p>

<p>"It shows that immorality doesn't matter if
it's combined with sound political principles,
old man."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>The Responsibilities of Genius.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Dr. Spink sat in his comfortable
dining room with his after-dinner
glass of wine before him. The snow
was falling and the rain beating
against the windows, but the Doctor had finished
his work, and feared only that some
sudden call would compel him to face the fury
of the weather again. A few months back he
would have greeted any summons, however
unreasonable the hour, and thought a new
patient well bought at the price of a spoiled
evening. But of late the world had smiled
upon him, the hill which had looked so steep
was proving easy to climb, and he was already
considering whether he should not take a partner,
to relieve him of the more irksome parts of
his duty. He pulled his neatly trimmed whisker
and caressed his smooth-shaven chin, as he
reflected how the folly of that mad fellow,
Roberts, had turned to his advantage. No
man could say that he had deviated an inch
from professional propriety, or pressed his advantage
the least unfairly. He had merely
persevered on the lines he laid down for himself
on his first arrival. The success, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
astonished even himself, had come to him,
partly no doubt, because merit must make its
way, but mainly because his rival had willfully
flung away his chances, preferring&mdash;and to Dr.
Spink it seemed a preference almost insane&mdash;to
speak his mind, whatever it might be, rather
than, like a wise man, hold his tongue and fill
his pockets.</p>

<p>So Roberts had willed, and hence the Vicarage,
the Grange, and many other houses now
knew his footstep no more, and Spink filled
his place. As he pondered on this, Dr. Spink
spared a pang of pity for his beaten competitor,
wondering what in the world the man meant to
live upon.</p>

<p>The door bell rang. He heard it with a sigh&mdash;the
half-pleased, half-weary, resigned sigh
that a man utters when fortune gives him no
rest in getting gain. A moment later he was
on his way to the surgery to see a lady who
would not send in her name or business.</p>

<p>He recognized Ethel Roberts with surprise,
when she raised her veil. They had known one
another to bow to, but he could not imagine
what brought her to his surgery.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Roberts! Is there anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dr. Spink, you must forgive me for
coming. I am in great trouble, and I thought
you might help me."</p>

<p>"Pray sit down. Is anyone ill&mdash;your little
boy?"</p>

<p>"No, he's not ill. It's&mdash;it's about my husband."</p>

<p>"I hope Mr. Roberts is not ill?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," she said nervously. "That's
what I want to ask you. Have you seen him
lately?"</p>

<p>"No, not very; I passed him in the street the
other day."</p>

<p>"He's gone to London, suddenly, I don't
know why. Oh, he's been so strange lately!"</p>

<p>"I thought he looked worried. Tell me
about it," said Dr. Spink, moved now with
genuine pity for the pale haggard face before
him.</p>

<p>"Ever since&mdash;but you mustn't tell I came to
you&mdash;or spoke to anybody, I mean&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>He reassured her, and she continued:</p>

<p>"Ever since his quarrel with Mr. Bannister&mdash;you
know about it?&mdash;there is something the
matter with him. He is moody, and absent-minded,
and&mdash;and hasty, and he settles to nothing.
And now he is gone off like this."</p>

<p>"Come, Mrs. Roberts, you must compose
yourself. I suppose he has let these politics
worry him."</p>

<p>"He seems to care nothing for&mdash;for his
home or the baby, you know; he does nothing
but read, or wander up and down the
room."</p>

<p>"It sounds as if he wanted a rest and a
change. You say he has gone away?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but on business, I think."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you much, unless he
calls me in and lets me have a look at him."</p>

<p>"He'll never do that!" she exclaimed, before
she could stop herself.</p>

<p>Dr. Spink took no notice of her outburst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he comes back no better, send me a
line, Mrs. Roberts, and we'll see. And mind
you let me know if you or the baby want any
advice."</p>

<p>"You're very kind, Dr. Spink. I&mdash;I'm sorry
James is so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a symptom. If he gets right, he
won't be like that. Your jacket's too thin for
such a night. Let me send you home in the
brougham."</p>

<p>Ethel refused the offer, and started on her
return, leaving Dr. Spink shaking a thoughtful
head in the surgery doorway.</p>

<p>"It really looks," he said, "as if he was a
bit queer. But what can I do? Poor little
woman!"</p>

<p>And, not being able to do anything, he
went back and finished his glass of port.
Then, for his dinner had been postponed till
late by business, and it was half-past ten, he
went to bed.</p>

<p>Ethel beat her way down the High Street
against the wind and snow, shutting her eyes
in face of the blinding shower, and pushing on
with all her speed to rejoin her baby, whom
she had left alone. When, wet and weary, she
reached her door, to her surprise she saw a man
waiting there. For a moment she joyously
thought it was her husband, but as the man
came forward to meet her, she recognized Philip
Hume.</p>

<p>"Out on such a night, Mrs. Roberts!"</p>

<p>She murmured an excuse, and he went on:</p>

<p>"Is the Doctor in? I came to look him up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he's away in London, Mr. Hume."</p>

<p>"In London? What for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"May I come in for a moment?" asked
Philip, who had been looking at her closely.</p>

<p>"If you like," she answered in some surprise.
"I'm afraid there's no fire."</p>

<p>Philip had followed her in and seen the grate
in the sitting room with no fire lighted.</p>

<p>"No fire?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"There is one in my room where baby is,"
she explained.</p>

<p>"There ought to be one here too," said he.
"You're looking ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not ill, Mr. Hume&mdash;I'm not indeed."</p>

<p>Philip had come on an errand. There are
uses even in gossips, and he had had a talk with
his friend the Mayor that day.</p>

<p>"Where are the coals?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There are some in the scuttle," she said.</p>

<p>He looked and found a few small pieces.
The fire was laid with a few more. Philip lit
them and threw on all the rest. Then he went
to the door, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Wilson!"</p>

<p>The small shrewd-faced man who waited on
Dale Bannister appeared. He was pushing a
wheelbarrow before him.</p>

<p>"Wheel it into the passage," said Philip;
"and then go. And, mind, not a word!"</p>

<p>Wilson looked insulted.</p>

<p>"I don't talk, sir," said he.</p>

<p>Philip returned to the room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Roberts," he said, "listen to me. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
a friend of your husband's. Will you let me
help you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I need no help."</p>

<p>"I know you are frozen," he went on; "and&mdash;where
is the servant?"</p>

<p>"She has left. I&mdash;I haven't got another yet,"
she faltered.</p>

<p>"In the passage," Philip went on, "there is a
wheelbarrow. It holds coals, food, and drink.
It's for you."</p>

<p>She started up.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;indeed I can't! Jim wouldn't like
it."</p>

<p>"Jim be hanged! I'll settle with him.
You're to take them. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. He walked up to her
and put a little canvas bag in her hands.</p>

<p>"There's money. No, take it. I shall keep
an account."</p>

<p>"I really don't need it."</p>

<p>"You do&mdash;you know you do. How much
money has he left you?"</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"He's not himself, he isn't indeed, Mr. Hume,
or he wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, of course he isn't. So I do what he
would, if he were himself. You were going to
starve."</p>

<p>"He will be angry."</p>

<p>"Then don't tell him. He'll never notice.
Now, will he?"</p>

<p>"He notices nothing now," she said.</p>

<p>"And you'll take them? Come, think of
what's-his-name&mdash;the baby, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're too kind to me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Of course we look after you,
Mrs. Roberts."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hume, do you think&mdash;what do you
think is the matter with Jim?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he's an old fool, Mrs. Roberts,
and you may tell him so from me. No, no, he'll
be all right in a week or two. Meanwhile, we're
going to make you and Tommy&mdash;oh, Johnny,
is it?&mdash;comfortable."</p>

<p>He did not leave her till she had consented
to accept all he offered; then he went back to
Littlehill.</p>

<p>"I think, Dale," he said, "Roberts must be
mad. He left his wife and child starving."</p>

<p>"Did she take the things?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I made her."</p>

<p>"That's all right. What a strange beggar he
is! He can't be quite right in his head."</p>

<p>"Fancy that poor little woman left like that!"</p>

<p>"Horrible!" said Dale, with a shudder. "At
any rate we can prevent that. I'm so glad you
thought of it."</p>

<p>"Old Hedger told me they had ordered
nothing for three days."</p>

<p>"How the deuce does Hedger know everything?"</p>

<p>"It's lucky he knew this, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, it is! Because, you know, Phil, I
feel a kind of responsibility."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Dale! Not really?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't laugh. Of course I couldn't
know the man was a sort of lunatic. One
doesn't write for lunatics."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps they ought to be considered, being
so numerous."</p>

<p>"However, it's all right now. Awfully obliged
to you, Phil."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he'll come back."</p>

<p>"Roberts? Why shouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he's quite capable of just
cutting the whole concern."</p>

<p>"I think he's capable of anything."</p>

<p>"Except appreciating 'Amor Patriæ,' eh?"</p>

<p>Dale, having got the Roberts family off his
mind, drifted to another topic.</p>

<p>"I say, Phil, old chap, will you stop playing
the fool for once, and give me your advice?"</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Philip, throwing himself
into an armchair.</p>

<p>"What," said Dale gravely, filling his pipe,
"do you think about getting married?"</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of it?"</p>

<p>"Discuss marriage in the abstract."</p>

<p>"It is a position of greater responsibility and
less freedom."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. But a lot depends on
the girl, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"I say, Phil, what do you think of Ripley?"</p>

<p>"He seemed a decent enough fellow."</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;I mean, do you call him an
attractive fellow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, uncommonly!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Well, why not?"</p>

<p>Dale fidgeted in his chair, and relit the pipe,
which had gone out. He was much too perturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to give to the filling of it the attention
that operation needs.</p>

<p>"I suppose he'll be rich, and a swell, and
all that," he went on.</p>

<p>"No doubt&mdash;but not a Victorian poet."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!"</p>

<p>"I meant it kindly. Some girls like poets."</p>

<p>"They were awfully kind about 'Amor
Patriæ' at the Grange to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, you've been there?"</p>

<p>"You know I have. Ripley was there. I
don't think I care much about him, Phil."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Does he like you?"</p>

<p>Dale laughed as he rose to go to bed.</p>

<p>"Not much, I think," said he.</p>

<p>Philip also, being left companionless, got up
and knocked out his pipe. Then he stood
looking into the dying embers for a minute or
two, and thinking, as he warmed his hands
with the last of the heat. "Poor little Nellie!"
he said. After a pause, he said it again; and
once again after that. But then, as saying it
was no use at all, he sighed and went to bed.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Mr. Delane Likes the Idea.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">On a bright morning, when February
was in one of its brief moods of kindliness,
Janet Delane was in the garden,
and flitting from it into the hothouses
in search of flowers. It was half-past eleven,
and Captain Ripley had kept her gossiping long
after breakfast; that was the worst of idle men
staying in a house. So she hastened to and
fro in a great parade of business-like activity,
and, as she went, she would sing blithely and
stop and smile to herself, and break into singing
again, and call merrily to her dog, a rotund,
slate-colored bundle of hair that waddled after
her, and answered, if he were given time to get
within earshot, to the name of Mop. Mop was
more sedate than his mistress: she only pretended
to be on business bent, while he had
been dragged out to take a serious constitutional
on account of his growing corpulence, and it
made him sulky to be called here and beckoned
there, and told there were rats, and cats, and
what not&mdash;whereas in truth there was no such
thing. But Janet did not mind his sulkiness;
she smiled, and sang, and smiled, for she was
thinking&mdash;but is nothing to be sacred from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
prying race? It is no concern of anyone's
what she was thinking, and no doubt she did
not desire it to be known, or she would have
told Captain Ripley in the course of that long
gossip.</p>

<p>The Captain stood gazing at her out of the
window, with his hands in his pockets and a
doleful look of bewilderment on his face. He
stared out into the garden, but he was listening
to Mrs. Delane, and wondering uneasily if he
were really such a dolt as his hostess seemed to
consider.</p>

<p>"You know, Gerard," said Mrs. Delane in
her usual tone of suave sovereignty, "that
I am anxious to help you all I can. I have
always looked forward to it as an event
which would give us all pleasure, and I know
my husband agrees with me. But really
we can't do anything if you don't help yourself."</p>

<p>The Captain gnawed his mustache and
thrust his hands deeper into his pockets.</p>

<p>"I can't make her out," said he. "I can't
get any farther with her."</p>

<p>"It's not the way to 'get farther,'" answered
Mrs. Delane, marking the quotation by a delicate
emphasis, "with any girl to stand on the
other side of the room and scowl whenever she
talks to another man."</p>

<p>"You mean Bannister?"</p>

<p>"I mean anybody. I don't care whether it's
Mr. Bannister or not. And it's just as useless
to pull a long face and look tragic whenever
she makes fun of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"She didn't use to be like that last time I
was home."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, what has that got to do with
it? She was a child then."</p>

<p>"She's always blowing me up. This morning
she asked me why I didn't go to India instead
of wasting my time doing nothing in
London."</p>

<p>This was certainly unfeeling conduct on
Janet's part. Mrs. Delane sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I quite understand her
either, Gerard. There's the Squire calling you.
He's ready to ride, I expect."</p>

<p>When Janet came, she found her mother
alone.</p>

<p>"Where's Gerard?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He's gone for a ride."</p>

<p>"Is he staying to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; two or three days, I think."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I am glad we amuse him.
There doesn't seem much for a man to do here,
does there?"</p>

<p>"Don't you like him to be here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind; only he wastes my time."</p>

<p>"I begin to think he's wasting his own too,"
remarked Mrs. Delane.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got nothing else to do with it&mdash;or
at least he does nothing else with it."</p>

<p>"You know what I mean, Janet, dear."</p>

<p>"I suppose I do, but how can I help it? I
do all I can to show him it's no use."</p>

<p>"You used to like him very much."</p>

<p>"Oh, so I do now. But that's quite different."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>The world goes very crooked. Mrs. Delane
sighed again.</p>

<p>"It would have pleased your father very
much."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry. But I couldn't care for a
man of that sort."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the man, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"That's just it, mamma. Nothing&mdash;nothing
bad&mdash;and nothing good. Gerard is like heaps
of men I know."</p>

<p>"I think you underrate him. His father was
just the same, and he was very distinguished in
the House."</p>

<p>Janet's gesture betrayed but slight veneration
for the High Court of Parliament, as she
answered: "They always say that about dull
people."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's no use, the sooner the poor boy
knows it the better."</p>

<p>"I can't tell him till he asks me, can I, dear?
Though I'm sure he might see it for himself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane, when she made up her mind to
sound her daughter's inclinations, had expected
to find doubt, indecision, perhaps even an
absence of any positive inclination toward
Captain Ripley. She had not been prepared
for Janet's unquestioning assumption that the
thing was not within the range of consideration.
A marriage so excellent from a material point
of view, with one who enjoyed all the advantages
old intimacy and liking could give, seemed
to claim more than the unhesitating dismissal
with which Janet relegated it to the limbo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
impossibility, with never a thought for all the
prospects it held out, and never a sigh for the
wealth and rank it promised. Of course the
Delanes needed no alliances to establish their
position; still, as the Squire had no son, it
would have been pleasant if his daughter had
chosen a husband from the leading family in
the county. The more Mrs. Delane thought,
the more convinced she became that there
must be a reason; and if there were, it could
be looked for only in one direction. She
wondered whether the Squire's <i>penchant</i> for
his gifted young neighbor was strong enough
to make him welcome him as a son-in-law.
Frankly, her own was not.</p>

<p>Mr. Delane came in to luncheon, but Captain
Ripley sent a message of excuse. He had
ridden over to Sir Harry Fulmer's, and would
spend the afternoon there. Mrs. Delane's reception
of the news conveyed delicately that
such conduct was only what might be expected,
if one considered how Janet treated the poor
fellow, but the Squire was too busy to appreciate
the subtleties of his wife's demeanor.</p>

<p>Important events were in the way to happen.
Denshire, like many other counties, had recently
made up its mind that it behooved it to educate
itself, and a building had arisen in Denborough
which was to serve as an institute of technical
education, a school of agriculture, a center of
learning, a home of instructive recreation, a
haven for the peripatetic lecturer, and several
things besides. Lord Cransford had consented
to open this temple of the arts, which was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
near completion, and an inauguration by him
would have been suitable and proper. But the
Squire had something far better to announce.
The Lord Lieutenant was, next month, to be
honored by a visit from a Royal Duke, and the
Royal Duke had graciously consented to come
over and open the Institute. It would be an
occasion the like of which Denborough had
seldom seen, and Lord Cransford and Mr.
Delane might well be pardoned the deputy-providential
air with which they went about for
the few days next following on the successful
completion of this delicate negotiation.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Squire, when he had detailed
the Prince's waverings and vacillations,
his he-woulds and he-would-nots, and the culmination
of his gracious assent, "I have a great
idea, and I want you to help me, Jan."</p>

<p>"How can I help?" asked Janet, who was
already in a flutter of loyalty.</p>

<p>"When the Duke comes, I want him to have
a splendid reception."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he will, my dear," said Mrs. Delane;
"at least I hope that we are loyal."</p>

<p>"We want," continued the Squire, "to show
him all our resources."</p>

<p>"Well, papa, that won't take him very long.
There's the old Mote Hall, and the Roman
pavement and&mdash;&mdash;Oh, but will he come here,
papa&mdash;to the Grange?"</p>

<p>"I hope he will take luncheon here."</p>

<p>"How delightful!" exclaimed Janet joyfully.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" said Mrs. Delane anxiously.</p>

<p>"But, Jan, I want to show him our poet!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa! Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I want Bannister to write a poem of
welcome."</p>

<p>"My dear," remarked Mrs. Delane, "Mr.
Bannister doesn't like princes;" and she smiled
satirically.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Jan?" asked the Squire,
smiling in his turn.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, do ask him, papa. I wish he
would."</p>

<p>"Well, will you ask him to?"</p>

<p>"Really, George, you are the person to suggest
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary. But if I fail? Now, Jan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be foolish papa. It's not
likely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Will you?"</p>

<p>But Janet had, it seemed, finished her meal;
at least she had left the room. Mrs. Delane
looked vexed. The Squire laughed, for he was
a man who enjoyed his little joke.</p>

<p>"Poor Jan!" he said. "It's a shame to chaff
her on her conquests."</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane's fears had been confirmed by her
daughter's reception of the raillery. She would
have answered in the same tone, and accepted
the challenge, if the banter had not hit the mark.</p>

<p>"It's a pity," said Mrs. Delane, "to encourage
her to think so much about this young
Bannister."</p>

<p>"Eh?" said the Squire, looking up from his
plate.</p>

<p>"She thinks quite enough about him already,
and hears enough, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he's something out of the
common run, in Denshire at all events, and so
he interests her."</p>

<p>"She'll have nothing to say to Gerard
Ripley."</p>

<p>"What? Has he asked her?"</p>

<p>"No; but I found out from her. He's quite
indifferent to her."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that, but there's time yet. I
don't give up hope."</p>

<p>"Do you think you help your wishes by asking
her to use her influence to make Dale Bannister
write poems?"</p>

<p>The Squire laid down his napkin and looked
at his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Delane. "Are you surprised?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, rather."</p>

<p>He got up and walked about the room, jangling
the money in his pocket.</p>

<p>"We know nothing about young Bannister,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Except that he's the son of a Dissenting
minister and has lived with very queer people."</p>

<p>The Squire frowned; but presently his face
cleared. "I dare say we're troubling ourselves
quite unnecessarily. I haven't noticed anything."</p>

<p>"I dare say not, George," said Mrs. Delane.</p>

<p>"Come, Mary, you know it's a weakness of
yours to find out people's love affairs before
they do themselves."</p>

<p>"Very well, George," answered she in a resigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
tone. "I have told you, and you will
act as you think best. Only, if you wouldn't
like him for a son-in-law&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, you do go ahead."</p>

<p>"Try to put him out of Janet's head, not in
it;" and Mrs. Delane swept out of the room.</p>

<p>The Squire went to his study, thinking as he
went. He would have liked the Ripley connection.
Lord Cransford was an old friend, and
the match would have been unimpeachable.
Still&mdash;&mdash; The Squire could not quite analyze
his feelings, but he did feel that the idea of Dale
Bannister was not altogether unattractive. By
birth, of course, he was a nobody, and he had
done and said, or at least said he had done, or
would like to do,&mdash;for the Squire on reflection
softened down his condemnation,&mdash;wild things;
but he was a distinguished man, a man of brains,
a force in the country. One must move with
the times. Nowadays brains opened every
front door, and genius was a passport everywhere.
He was not sure that he disliked the
idea. Women were such sticklers for old
notions. Now, he had never been a&mdash;stick-in-the-mud
Tory. If Dale went on improving as
he was doing, the Squire would think twice before
he refused him. But there! very likely it
was only Mary's match-making instincts making
a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p>"I shall keep at Jan about that poem," he
ended by saying. "It would be a fine facer for
the Radicals."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>How It Seemed to the Doctor.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">James Roberts made to himself
some excuse of business for his sudden
expedition to London, but in
reality he was moved to go by the
desire for sympathy. There are times and
moods when a man will do many strange
things, if thereby he may gain the comfort of
an approving voice. It was not so much his
straitened means and impoverished household,
with the silent suppressed reproach of his wife's
sad face, which made Denborough for the time
uninhabitable to the Doctor. The selfishness
engendered by his absorption in outside affairs
armed him against these; he was more
oppressed, and finally overcome and routed to
flight, by the universal, unbroken, and unhesitating
condemnation and contempt that he met
with. The severe banned him as wicked, the
charitable dubbed him crazy; even Johnstone,
whom he had bought, gave him no sympathy.
He could not share his savage sneers, or his
bitter mirth, or his passionate indignation, with
a man to whom the whole affair was a matter
of business or of personal grudge. He felt that
he must escape for a time, and seek society in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
which he could unbosom himself and speak
from his heart without stirring horror or ridicule.
Arthur Angell at least, who, in regard to
Dale and Dale's views, had always been a better
royalist than the King, would share his anger
and appreciate his meditated revenge. The
lesson he meant to give the backslider was so
appropriate and of such grim humor that Arthur
must be delighted with it.</p>

<p>On Dale's departure, Arthur Angell had
moved into the little flat at the top of the tall
building in Chelsea, and there he cultivated the
Muses with a devotion which was its own ample
reward. Though to be passing rich on forty
pounds a year is, with the best will, impossible
in London as it is to-day, yet to be passing
happy on one hundred and fifty is not beyond
the range of youth and enthusiasm, when the
future still provides a gorgeous setting and
background, wherein the sordid details of the
present are merged and lose their prominence,
and all trials are but landmarks by which the
hopeful grub counts his nearer approach to
butterflydom. The little room, the humble
chop, the occasional pit, the constant tobacco,
the unending talks with fellows like-minded and
like-pursed&mdash;all these had the beauty of literary
tradition, and if not a guarantee, seemed at
least a condition of future fame. So Arthur
often said to Mrs. Hodge, who lived in the same
block, a couple of floors lower down; and Mrs.
Hodge heartily agreed as she instanced, in confirmation
of the doctrine, how the late Mr.
Hodge had once played the King at two pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
ten, <i>consule Pratt</i>, and had lived to manage his
own theater. This was to compare small things
with great, felt Arthur, but the truth is true in
whatever sphere it works.</p>

<p>Into his happy life there broke suddenly the
tempestuous form of the Denborough Doctor.
He arrived with but a pound or two in his
pocket with wild ideas of employment on ultra-Radical
newspapers; above all, with the full
load of his rage against Dale Bannister, the
traitor. He strode up and down the little room,
tugging his beard and fiercely denouncing the
renegade, while Arthur looked at his troubled
eyes and knitted brows, and wondered if his
mind were not unhinged. Who could talk like
that about Dale, if he were sane? Arthur would
have chaffed his friend, laughed at him, ridiculed
him, perhaps slyly hinted at the illicit
charms of rank and wealth, for which the poet's
old mistress mourned deserted. But to speak
in hate and rancor! And what was he plotting?</p>

<p>But when he heard the plot, his face cleared,
and he laughed.</p>

<p>"I think you're hard on Dale," he said;
"but, after all, it will be a good joke."</p>

<p>"Johnstone will do it," exclaimed the Doctor,
pausing in his stride. "His shop window will
be full of them. He'll have sandwich-men all
over the place. Bannister won't be able to go
out without being met by his own words&mdash;the
words he denies. I'll cram them down his
throat."</p>

<p>Arthur laughed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be awkward when he's walking with
old Delane."</p>

<p>"Aye, and with that girl who's got hold of
him. He shan't forget what he wrote&mdash;nor
shall a soul in Denborough either. I'll make
his treachery plain, if I spend my last farthing."</p>

<p>"When are you going back?"</p>

<p>"In a week. It will all be ready in a week.
He'll know who did it. Curse him!"</p>

<p>"My dear Doctor, aren't you a little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you like that, too?" burst out Roberts.
"Have none of you any sincerity? Is it sham
with all of you? You laugh as if it were a
joke."</p>

<p>"I can't be angry with old Dale. I expect
he'll only laugh himself, you know. It will be
good fun."</p>

<p>Roberts looked at him in hopeless wrath. It
seemed to him that these men, who wrote the
words and proclaimed the truths which had
turned his life and reformed his soul, were
themselves but playing with what they taught.
Were they only actors&mdash;or amusing themselves?</p>

<p>"You are as bad as he is," he said angrily,
and stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>Arthur, puzzled with his unmanageable
guest, went down, as he often did, to his neighbors,
and laid the whole case before Mrs.
Hodge and Nellie Fane. He found them both
in, Nellie having just returned from an afternoon
concert where she had been singing.</p>

<p>"I believe the fellow's half mad, you know,"
said Arthur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he isn't, he ought to be ashamed of
himself," said Mrs. Hodge, and she launched
on a description of Mrs. Robert's pitiable
state.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think that he's got more than
five pounds in the world," responded Arthur.
"And he's got no chance of making any
money. Nobody dares publish what he wants
to write."</p>

<p>"He used to be pleasant at Littlehill,"
Nellie remarked, "when we were first there."</p>

<p>"Yes, wasn't he? But he's gone quite
wild over Dale. Do you know what his next
move is?" And Arthur disclosed the Johnstone
conspiracy.</p>

<p>"It will be rather sport, won't it?" he asked.
"Poor old Dale!"</p>

<p>But no; Miss Fane did not see the "sport."
She was indignant; she thought that such a
trick was mean, malicious, and odious in the
highest degree, and she was surprised that
Arthur Angell could be amused at it.</p>

<p>"Women never see a joke," said Arthur
huffily.</p>

<p>"Where's the joke in making Dale unhappy
and&mdash;and absurd? And you call yourself his
friend!"</p>

<p>"It's only a joke. Old Dale does deserve a
dig, you know."</p>

<p>"And pray, why? You choose your friends,
why mayn't he choose his? I dare say you
would be glad enough to know that sort of
people if you could."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Nellie! I'm not like that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Besides, it's not the people; it's what he's
written."</p>

<p>"I've read what he's written. It's beautiful.
No, I call the whole thing horrid, and just like
Dr. Roberts."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think, just like me, too?"</p>

<p>"If you don't write and warn Dale, I shall."</p>

<p>"I say, you mustn't do that. I told you in
confidence. Roberts will be furious."</p>

<p>"What do I care for Dr. Roberts' fury? I
shall write at once;" and she sat down at the
table.</p>

<p>Arthur glanced in despair at Mrs. Hodge,
but that discreet lady was entirely hidden in
the evening paper.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll never tell you anything again,
Nellie," he said.</p>

<p>"You'll never have the chance, unless you
behave something like a gentleman," retorted
Nellie.</p>

<p>Arthur banged the door as he went out,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Damn Roberts! What does he want to
make a row for?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Doctor, who was angry
enough with Arthur Angell to have rejoiced
had he known that he had embroiled him in a
quarter where Arthur was growing very anxious
to stand well, was pacing the streets, nursing
his resentment. His head ached, and fragments
of what he had read, and half-forgotten conversations,
mingling in his whirling brain,
fretted and bewildered him. He could think
of nothing but his wrongs and his revenge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
returning always to hug himself on his own
earnestness, and angrily to sneer at the weakness
and treachery of his friends. Whatever it
cost him or his, the world should see that there
was one man ready to sacrifice himself for
truth and right&mdash;and punish "that hound Dale
Bannister."</p>

<p>As he walked, he bought the special edition
of the paper, and, in hastily glancing at it, his
eye was caught by the announcement that His
Royal Highness the Duke of Mercia was to
visit Lord Cransford, and would open the Institute
at Market Denborough. The paragraph
went on to describe the preparations being
made to give the Prince a loyal reception, and
ended by saying that it was hoped that the
eminent poet, Mr. Dale Bannister, who was
resident at Denborough, would consent to write
a few lines of welcome to the illustrious visitor.
The writer added a word or two of good-natured
banter about Mr. Bannister's appearance in a
new character, and the well-known effect which
the proximity of royalty was apt to have on
English republicanism. "Who knows," he
concluded, "that Mr. Bannister may not figure
as Sir Dale before long?"</p>

<p>The Doctor read the paragraph twice, the
flush of anger reddening his pale face. Then
he crumpled up the paper and flung it from
him, resuming his hasty, restless walk. He
could imagine the sickening scene, the rampant
adulation, the blatant snobbishness. And, in
the midst, a dishonored participator, the man
who had been his leader, his liberator, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
apostle of all he loved and lived by. Had the
man been a hypocrite from the first? Impossible!
No hypocrite could have written those
burning lines which leaped to his memory and
his lips. Or was he merely a weak fool? That
could not be either. It was a barter, a deliberate
barter of truth and honor against profit&mdash;as
sordid a transaction as could be. He wanted a
position in society, money, a rich wife, petting
from great people&mdash;perhaps even, as that scribbler
said, a ribbon to stick in his coat or a handle
to fasten to his name. How could he? how
could he? And the Doctor passed his hand
across his hot, throbbing brow in the bewilderment
of wrath.</p>

<p>For an hour and more he ranged the streets
aimlessly, a prey to his unreasoning fury. For
this man's sake he had ruined himself; led on
by this man's words, he had defied the world&mdash;his
world. At all hazards he had joined the
daring band. Now he was forsaken, abandoned,
flung aside. He and his like had served
their turn. On their backs Dale Bannister had
mounted. But now he had done with them,
and their lot was repudiation and disdain.
Roberts could not find words for his scorn and
contempt. His head racked him more and
more. Connected thought seemed to become
impossible; he could do nothing but repeat
again and again, "The traitor! The traitor!"</p>

<p>At last he turned home to his humble lodgings.
The short hush of very early morning
had fallen on the streets; he met no one, and
the moon shone placidly down on the solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
figure of the maddened man, wrestling with his
unconquerable rage. He could not stem it;
yielding to its impulse, with quivering voice and
face working with passion, he stretched his
clenched fist to the sky and cried:</p>

<p>"By God, he shall pay for it!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>"No More Kings."</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">After her father's report and the
departure of Nellie Fane, Miss Tora
Smith had been pleased to reconsider
her judgment of Dale Bannister, and
to modify it to some extent. The poems and
the suspicion, taken in conjunction, each casting
a lurid light on the other, had been very bad
indeed; but when Tora's mind was disabused
of the suspicion, she found it in her heart to
pardon the poems. Although she treated Sir
Harry Fulmer with scant ceremony, she had no
small respect for his opinion, and when he and
the Colonel coincided in the decision that Dale
need not be ostracized, she did not persist
against them. She was led to be more compliant
by the fact that she was organizing an
important Liberal gathering, and had conceived
the ambition of inducing Dale to take part in
the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Fancy, if he would write us a song!" she
said; "a song which we could sing in chorus.
Wouldn't it be splendid?"</p>

<p>"What would the Squire say?" asked Sir
Harry.</p>

<p>Tora smiled mischievously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you," she demanded, "going to stand
by and see him captured by the Grange?"</p>

<p>"He ought to be with us, oughtn't he?"
said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Of course. And if our leader had an ounce
of zeal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll write to him to-day," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes; and mind you persuade him. I shall
be so amused to see what Jan Delane says, if
he writes us a song."</p>

<p>"He won't do it."</p>

<p>"He won't, if you go in that despairing
mood. Now write at once. Write as if you
expected it."</p>

<p>The outcome of this conversation, together
with the idea which had struck the Squire, was,
of course, that Dale received, almost by the
same post, an urgent request for a militant
Radical ditty, and a delicate, but very flattering,
suggestion that it would be most agreeable to
His Royal Highness&mdash;indeed he had hinted as
much in response to Lord Cransford's question&mdash;to
find the loyalty of Denborough, as it
were, crystallized in one of Mr. Bannister's undying
productions. For the first time in his
life, Dale felt a grudge against the Muses for
their endowment. Could not these people let
him alone? He did not desire to put himself
forward; he only asked to be let alone. It was
almost as repugnant to him&mdash;at least, he
thought it would be&mdash;to take part in Lord
Cransford's pageant, as it certainly would be to
hear the Radicals of Denborough screeching
out his verses. He was a man of letters, not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
politician, and he thought both requests very
uncalled for. It might be that the Grange folks
had some claim on him, but his acquaintance
with Sir Harry Fulmer was of the slightest; and
what did the man mean by talking of his "well-known
views"? He was as bad as the Doctor
himself. Presently Philip Hume came in, and
Dale disclosed his perplexities.</p>

<p>"I want to please people," he said, "but this
is rather strong."</p>

<p>"Write both," suggested Philip.</p>

<p>"That will enrage both of them."</p>

<p>"Then write neither."</p>

<p>"Really, Phil, you might show some interest
in the matter."</p>

<p>"I am preoccupied. Have you been in the
town to-day, Dale?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't seen Johnstone's window?"</p>

<p>"Johnstone's window? What does Johnstone
want with a window?"</p>

<p>"Put on your hat and come and see. Yes,
come along. It concerns you."</p>

<p>They walked down together in the gathering
dusk of the afternoon, and when they came
near Johnstone's, they saw his window lighted
with a blaze of gas, and a little knot of curious
people standing outside. The window was full
of Dale's books, and the rows of green volumes
were surmounted by a large placard&mdash;"Dale
Bannister, the poet of Denborough&mdash;Works on
Sale Here. Ask for 'The Clarion,' 'The Arch
Apostates,' 'Blood for Blood'"; and outside, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
file of men carried boards, headed, "The
Rights of the People. Read Dale Bannister!
No more Kings! No more Priests! Read
Dale Bannister!"</p>

<p>A curse broke from Dale. Philip smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>"Who's done this?" Dale asked.</p>

<p>Philip pointed to a solitary figure which stood
on the opposite side of the road, looking on at
the spectacle. It was James Roberts, and he
smiled grimly in his turn when he saw the poet
and his friend.</p>

<p>"He put Johnstone up to it," said Philip.
"Johnstone told me so."</p>

<p>Dale was aflame. He strode quickly across
the road to where the Doctor stood, and said to
him hotly:</p>

<p>"This is your work, is it?"</p>

<p>The Doctor was jaunty and cool in manner.</p>

<p>"No, your works," he answered, with a
foolish, exasperating snigger. "Aren't you
pleased to see what notice they are attracting?
I was afraid they were being forgotten in
Denborough."</p>

<p>"God only knows," said Dale angrily, "why
you take pleasure in annoying me; but I have
borne enough of your insolence."</p>

<p>"Is it insolent to spread the sale of your
books?"</p>

<p>"You will make your jackal take those books
down and stop his infernal posters, or I'll thrash
you within an inch of your life."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Roberts, and his hand stole
toward his breast-pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say that if I can make a wretched snob
like you unhappy, it's money well spent, and
I'll see you damned before I take the books
down."</p>

<p>Dale grasped his walking-cane and took a
step forward. The Doctor stood waiting for
him, smiling and keeping his hand in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>The Doctor turned and saw his wife at his
side. Dale fell back, lifting his hat, at the sight
of the pale distressed face and clasped hands.</p>

<p>"Do come home, dear!" she said, with an
appealing glance.</p>

<p>Philip took Dale's arm.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "let's reason with Johnstone."</p>

<p>Dale allowed himself to be led away, not
knowing that death had stared him in the face;
for it was a loaded revolver that Roberts let fall
back into the recesses of his pocket when his
wife's touch recalled for a moment his saner
sense.</p>

<p>The reasoning with Johnstone was not a
success. Dale tried threats, abuse, and entreaties,
all in vain. At last he condescended
to bribery, and offered Johnstone twice the sum,
whatever it might be, which he had received.
He felt his degradation, but the annoyance was
intolerable.</p>

<p>The Alderman's attitude, on receiving this
offer, was not without pathos. He lamented in
himself an obstinate rectitude, which he declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
had often stood in his way in business affairs.
His political convictions, engaged as they were
in the matter, he would have sacrificed, if the
favor thereby accorded to Mr. Bannister were
so great as to be measured by two hundred
pounds; but he had passed his word; and he
concluded by beseeching Dale not to tempt him
above that which he was able.</p>

<p>"Take it away, take it away, sir," he said
when Dale held a pocketbook before his longing
eyes. "It aint right, sir, it aint indeed&mdash;and
me a family man."</p>

<p>Dale began to feel the guilt of the Tempter,
and fell back on an appeal to the Alderman's
better feelings. This line of argument elicited
only a smile.</p>

<p>"If I won't do it for two hundred sovereigns,
does it stand to reason, sir, as I should do it to
obleege?"</p>

<p>Dale left him, after a plain statement of the
estimation in which he held him, and went
home, yielding, only after a struggle, to Philip's
representation that any attempt to bribe the
sandwich-men must result in his own greater
humiliation and discomfiture.</p>

<p>Angry as Dale was, he determined not to
allow this incident to turn him from the course
he had marked out for himself. It confirmed
his determination to have nothing to do with
Sir Harry's Radical song, but it did not make
him any the more inclined to appear as a
eulogist of royalty. Neutrality in all political
matters was his chosen course, and it appeared
to him to be incomparably the wisest under all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the circumstances. This view he expressed to
the family at the Grange, having walked over
for that purpose. He expected to meet with
some opposition, but to his surprise the Squire
heartily acquiesced.</p>

<p>"After this scandalous business," he said,
"you must cut the Radicals altogether. Of
course, Harry Fulmer will object to it as much
as we do, but he must be responsible for his
followers. And I think you're quite right to
let us alone, too. Why should you literary men
bother with politics?"</p>

<p>Dale was delighted at this opinion, and at
Janet's concurrence with it.</p>

<p>"Then I dare say you will be so kind as to
express my feelings to Lord Cransford; if he
thinks fit, he can let the Duke know them."</p>

<p>The Squire's face expressed surprise, and his
daughter's reflected it.</p>

<p>"But, my dear fellow," said Mr. Delane,
"what has Cransford's suggestion to do with
politics? The throne is above politics."</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Bannister," added Janet, "we
are all loyal, whatever our politics? I'm sure
Sir Harry himself is as loyal as papa."</p>

<p>"Come, Bannister, you press your scruples
too far. There are no politics in this."</p>

<p>Dale was staggered, but not convinced.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not put myself forward at all,"
he said.</p>

<p>The Squire assumed an air of apologetic
friendliness.</p>

<p>"I know you'll excuse me, Bannister. I'm
twice your age or more, and I&mdash;well&mdash;I haven't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
been so lucky as you in escaping the world of
etiquette. But, my dear fellow, when the Duke
sends a message&mdash;it really comes to that&mdash;it's
a strongish thing to say you won't do it. Oh,
of course, you can if you like&mdash;there's no
beheading nowadays; but it's not very
usual."</p>

<p>"I wish Lord Cransford had never mentioned
me to the Duke at all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would have been wiser," the
Squire conceded candidly, "but Cransford is
so proud of anything that brings <i>kudos</i> to the
county, and he could no more leave you out
than he could the Institute itself. Well, we
mustn't force you. Think it over, think it over.
I must be off. No, don't you go. Stay and have
tea with the ladies;" and the Squire, who, as
has been previously mentioned, was no fool, left
his daughter to entertain his guest.</p>

<p>Janet was working at a piece of embroidery,
and she went on working in silence for a minute
or two. Then she looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Tora Smith was here this morning. She'll
be very disappointed at your refusal to write
for her meeting."</p>

<p>"Miss Smith has no claim on me," said Dale
stiffly. He had not forgotten Tora's injurious
suspicions. "Besides, one doesn't do such
things simply for the asking&mdash;not even if it's a
lady who asks."</p>

<p>"You know, I don't think anybody ought to
ask&mdash;no, not princes; and I hope you won't do
what Lord Cransford wants merely because
you're asked."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father says I ought."</p>

<p>"Papa wants you to do it very much."</p>

<p>"And I should like to do what he wants."</p>

<p>"I should like you to do what he wants, but
not because he wants it," said Janet.</p>

<p>Dale turned round to her and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I'll do it, if you want me to."</p>

<p>Now this was flattering, and Janet could not
deny that it gave her pleasure; but she clung
to her principles.</p>

<p>"I don't want it&mdash;in that sense," she answered.
"I should be glad if it seemed to you a right
thing to do; but I should be sorry if you did it,
unless it did."</p>

<p>"You will not let me do it for you?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"You have no pleasure in obedience?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, only in willing obedience," said she,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"It would be very willing&mdash;even eager."</p>

<p>"The motive would not be right. But how
absurd! I believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"That you mean to do it, and are trying to
kill two birds with one stone."</p>

<p>"You don't really think that, Miss Delane?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Only you were becoming
so serious."</p>

<p>"May I not be serious?"</p>

<p>"It isn't serious to offer to take important
steps because it would please a girl."</p>

<p>"Aren't you rather contradicting yourself?
You called that becoming serious just now."</p>

<p>"If I am, it is a privilege we all have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Girls, you mean? Well, you refuse to help
me?"</p>

<p>"Entirely."</p>

<p>"Even to counteract Miss Smith's illicit
influence?"</p>

<p>"I shall trust to your own sense of propriety."</p>

<p>Dale walked home, grievously puzzled. A
small matter may raise a great issue, and he
felt, perhaps without full reason, that he was at
the parting of the ways. "No more Kings! No
more Priests!" Or "An Ode to H. R. H. the
Duke of Mercia on his visit to Denborough"!
Dale ruefully admitted that there would be
ground for a charge of inconsistency. Some
would talk of conversion, some of tergiversation;
he could not make up his mind which accusation
would be the more odious. There was clearly
nothing for it but absolute neutrality; he must
refuse both requests. Janet would understand
why; of course she would, she must; and even if
she did not, what was that to him? The throne
above politics!&mdash;that must be a mere sophism;
there could not be anything in that. No doubt
this young Prince was not morally responsible
for the evils, but he personified the system, and
Dale could not bow the knee before him. If it
had been possible&mdash;and as he went he began idly
to frame words for an ode of welcome. An idea
or two, a very happy turn, came into his head;
he knew exactly the tone to take, just how far
to go, just the mean that reconciles deference to
independence. He had the whole thing mapped
out before he recalled to himself the thought
that he was not going to write at all, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
he entered his own garden he sighed at the
necessary relinquishing of a stately couplet.
There was no doubt that work of that class
opened a new field, a hitherto virgin soil, to
his genius. It was a great pity.</p>

<p>In the garden, to his surprise, he came on
Arthur Angell. "What brings you here,
Arthur?" he said. "Delighted to see you,
though."</p>

<p>Arthur explained that he had run down at
Nellie Fane's bidding. Nellie had written her
letter of warning about the Doctor's conspiracy,
but, having thus relieved her mind, had straightway
forgotten all about her letter, and it had
lain unposted in her pocket for a week. Then
she found it, and sent Arthur off in haste to
stop the mischief.</p>

<p>"It's awfully kind of Nellie," said Dale; "but
I don't suppose it would have been of any use,
and anyhow it's too late now."</p>

<p>"Yes, so Phil told me."</p>

<p>"A dirty trick, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it's rather rough on you,"
said Arthur, struggling between principles and
friendship, and entirely suppressing his own
privity to the said dirty trick.</p>

<p>"You'll stay?"</p>

<p>"I've got no clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Wilson will see to that. Come in."</p>

<p>Philip met them at the door.</p>

<p>"I've a message for you, Dale," he said.
"The Mayor has been here."</p>

<p>"And what may the Mayor want?"</p>

<p>"The Mayor came as an ambassador. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
bore a resolution from the Town Council, a
unanimous resolution (<i>absente</i> Johnstone owing
to pressure in the bookselling trade), begging
you to accede to the Lord Lieutenant's request
and write a poem for the Duke."</p>

<p>"Hang the Town Council!" exclaimed Dale.
"I wonder why nobody will let me alone!"</p>

<p>Then he remembered that Miss Delane had
been almost ostentatious in her determination
to let him alone. If he wrote, they could not
say that he had written to please her. But he
was not going to write. True, it would have
been a good revenge on the Doctor, and it
would have pleased&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall you do the ode?" asked Philip Hume.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," answered Dale in a resolute
tone.</p>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Dale tries His Hand at an Ode.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Dale's preoccupations with his new
friends had thrown on Philip Hume
the necessity of seeking society for
himself, if he did not wish to spend
many solitary evenings at Littlehill. The resources
of Denborough were not very great,
and his dissipation generally took the form of
a quiet dinner, followed by a rubber of whist,
at Mount Pleasant. The Colonel and he suited
one another, and, even if Philip had been
less congenial in temper, the Colonel was often
too hard put to it for a fourth player to be
nice in scrutinizing the attractions of anyone
who could be trusted to answer a call and appreciate
the strategy of a long suit. Even with
Philip's help the rubber was not a brilliant one;
for Tora only played out of filial duty, and Sir
Harry came in to join because it was better to
be with Tora over a whist-table than not to be
with her at all. That he thought so witnessed
the intensity of his devotion, for to play whist
seemed to Sir Harry to be going out of one's
way to seek trouble and perplexity of mind.</p>

<p>On the evening of Arthur Angell's arrival the
usual party had dined together and set to work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Things were not going well. At dinner they
had discussed the royal visit, and the Colonel
had been disgusted to find that his daughter,
unmindful of her, or rather his, principles, was
eager to see and, if it might be, to speak with
"this young whippersnapper of a Prince."
The Colonel could not understand such a state
of feeling, but Tora was firm. All the county
would be there in new frocks; she had ordered
a new frock, of which she expected great things,
and she meant to be there in it; it would not
do, she added, for the Duke to think that the
Radicals had no pretty girls on their side. The
Colonel impatiently turned to Sir Harry; but
Sir Harry agreed with Tora, and even Philip
Hume announced his intention of walking down
High Street to see, not the Prince of course, but
the people and the humors of the day.</p>

<p>"Really, Colonel," he said, "I cannot miss
the Mayor."</p>

<p>"Are we going to have a rubber or not?"
asked the Colonel with an air of patient weariness.</p>

<p>They sat down, Sir Harry being his host's
partner. Now, Sir Harry was, and felt himself
to be, in high favor, owing to his sound views
on the question of the day, and he was thinking
of anything in the world rather than the fall of
the cards. Consequently his play was marked
by somewhat more than its ordinary atrociousness,
and the Colonel grew redder and redder
as every scheme he cherished was nipped in the
bud by his partner's blunders. Tora and Philip
held all the cards, and their good fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
covered Tora's deficiency in skill, and made
Philip's sound game seem a brilliant one.</p>

<p>At last the Colonel could bear it no longer.
He broke up the party, and challenged Philip to
a game of piquet.</p>

<p>"At any rate, one hasn't a partner at piquet,"
he said.</p>

<p>Sir Harry smiled, and followed Tora to the
drawing room. With such rewards for bad
play, who would play well? He sat down by
her and watched her making spills. Presently
he began to make spills too. Tora looked at
him. Sir Harry made a very bad spill indeed,
and held it up with a sigh.</p>

<p>"That's the sort of thing," he said, "I have
to light my pipe with at home!"</p>

<p>"As you've been very good to-night,"
answered Tora, "I'll give you some of mine to
take with you. Let me show you how to do
them for yourself."</p>

<p>Then ensued trivialities which bear happening
better than they do recording&mdash;glances and
touches and affectations of stupidity on one side
and impatience on the other&mdash;till love's ushers,
their part fulfilled, stand by to let their master
speak, and the hidden seriousness, which made
the trifles not trifling, leaps to sudden light.
Before her lover's eager rush of words, his
glorifying of her, his self-depreciation, Tora was
defenseless, her raillery was gone, and she
murmured nothing but:</p>

<p>"You're <i>not</i> stupid&mdash;you're <i>not</i> dull. Oh,
how can you!"</p>

<p>Before he set out for home Philip Hume was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
privileged to hear the fortunate issue, and to
wonder how much happiness two faces can
manage to proclaim. Kindly as the little family
party took him into their confidence, he hastened
away, knowing that he had no place
there. Such joys were not for him, he thought,
as he walked slowly from the door, remembering
how once he had challenged impossibility,
and laid his love at a girl's feet; and she, too,
had for a moment forgotten impossibility; and
they were very happy&mdash;for a moment; then
they recollected&mdash;or had it recollected for them&mdash;that
they were victims of civilization. And
hence an end. Philip recalled this incident as
he walked. He had not thought of it for a
long time, but the air of Denborough seemed
so full of love and love-making that he spared
a sigh or two for himself. Well born and well
educated, he wrung from the world, by painful
labor, some three or four hundred pounds a
year. It was enough if he had not been
well born or well educated; but his advantages
turned to disabilities, and he saw youth going
or gone, and the home and the love which had
been so confidently assumed as his lot, that
even as a boy he had joked and been joked
about them, faded away from his picture of the
future, and he was only kept from a sigh of
self-pity by reminding himself of the ludicrous
commonplaceness of his grievance against fate.
He knew men so situated by dozens, and nobody
thought them ill used. No more they
were, he supposed; at least, it seemed nobody's
fault, and, in view of sundry other sad things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
in the world, not a matter to make a fuss
about.</p>

<p>He found Dale in high spirits; for Dale had
conceived a benevolent scheme, by which he
was to make two of his friends happy&mdash;as happy
as Tora Smith and Harry Fulmer, the news of
whom he heard with the distant interest to
which Tora's bygone hostility restricted him.
He and Arthur Angell had dined together,
smoked together, and drunk whisky and water
together, and the floodgates of confidence had
been opened; a thing prone to occur under
such circumstances, a thing that seems then
very natural, and reserves any appearance of
strangeness for next morning's cold meditations.
Dale had chanted Janet's charms, and
Arthur had been emboldened to an antistrophe
in praise of Nellie Fane. It was a revelation
to Dale&mdash;a delightful revelation. It would be
ideally suitable, and it was his pleasure that the
happy issue should be forwarded by all legitimate
means.</p>

<p>"Arthur's going to stay," he said; "and I've
written to Nellie to tell her to come down with
her mother."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Of course, I've said nothing about Arthur.
I've put it on the royal visit. She'd like to be
here for that anyhow; and when she's here,
Arthur must look out for himself."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't he do it in London? They
live on the same pair of stairs," objected
Philip.</p>

<p>"Oh, London! who the deuce could make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
love in London?" asked Dale in narrow-minded
ignorance. "People's faces are always dirty in
London."</p>

<p>Philip smiled, but this new plan seemed to
him a bad one. It was one of Dale's graces to
be unconscious of most of his triumphs, and it
had evidently never struck him that Nellie's
affections would offer any obstacle to the
scheme, or cause her fatally to misinterpret
what the scheme was.</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Philip, "that she is more
likely to be captivated by our young friend here
than in London."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, he's at work there, and so
is she. Here they'll have nothing else to do."</p>

<p>While Dale chattered over his great idea,
Philip pondered whether to interfere or not.
He was certain that Nellie had been fond, not
of Arthur Angell, but of Dale himself; he
feared she would think her invitation came from
Dale's own heart, not in favor to a friend, and
he suspected the kindness would end in pain.
But, on the other hand, affections change, and
there is such a thing as falling back on the
good when the better is out of reach; and,
finally, there is a sound general principle that
where it is doubtful whether to hold one's
tongue or not, one's tongue should be held.
Philip held his.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and said:</p>

<p>"If this goes on, a bachelor won't be safe in
Denborough. What have you been doing?"
and he pointed at some scribbling which lay on
the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Dale flushed a little.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've just been trying my hand at that
little thing they want me to do&mdash;you know."</p>

<p>"For the Radical meeting?"</p>

<p>"No, no. For the Duke of Mercia's visit."</p>

<p>"Oh! So you're going to do it?"</p>

<p>Dale assumed a candid yet judicial air.</p>

<p>"If I find I can say anything gracious and
becoming, without going back on my principles,
Phil, I think I shall. Otherwise not."</p>

<p>"I see, old fellow. Think you will be able?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to budge an inch from my
true position for anybody."</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard on the Duke. He's a
young man."</p>

<p>Dale became suspicious that he was being
treated with levity; he looked annoyed, and
Philip hastened to add:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, write your poem, and never
mind what people tell you about your principles.
Why shouldn't you write some verses to the
young man?"</p>

<p>"That's what I say," replied Dale eagerly.
"It doesn't compromise me in the least. I
think you're quite right, Phil."</p>

<p>And he sat down again with a radiant
expression.</p>

<p>Philip lit his pipe, and drew his chair near
the fire, listening idly to the light scratchings of
the writing and the heavy scratchings of the
erasures.</p>

<p>"You seem to scratch out a lot, Dale," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"A thing's no good," said Dale, without turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
round, "till you've scratched it all out twice
at least."</p>

<p>"It's a pity, then," said Philip, pulling at his
pipe and looking into the fire, "that we aren't
allowed to treat life like that."</p>

<p>His words struck a chord in Dale's memory.
He started up, and repeated:</p>

<p class="pl0">"The moving Finger writes, and having writ</p>
<p class="pl1">Moves on, nor all your piety nor wit</p>
<p class="pl1">Can lure it back to cancel half a line,</p>
<p class="pl1">Nor all your tears wash out a word of it."</p>

<p class="p1">"And yet," said Philip, stretching out a hand
to the flickering blaze, "we go on being pious
and wise&mdash;some of us; and we go on crying&mdash;all
of us."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Delilah Johnstone.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">When it became known to Mr. Delane
that the ode of welcome would be
forthcoming,&mdash;a fact which, without
being definitely announced, presently
made its way into general knowledge,&mdash;he felt
that he owed Dale Bannister a good turn. The
young man was obviously annoyed and hurt at
the aspect of Alderman Johnstone's window, and
the Squire could not, moreover, conceal from
himself that the parade of the Alderman's sandwich-men
on the day of the royal visit would
detract from the unanimity of loyalty and contentment
with Queen and Constitution which he
felt Denborough ought to display. Finally, his
wife and his daughter were so strongly of
opinion that something must be done that he
had no alternative but to try to do something.
Intimidation had failed; the Alderman intrenched
himself behind his lease; and Colonel
Smith's open triumph was hardly needed to
show the Squire that in this matter he had
been caught napping. Bribery of a direct and
pecuniary sort was apparently also of no avail,
and the Squire was driven to play his last card
at the cost of great violence to his own feelings.
A week before the great day he sent for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Mayor and was closeted with him for half an
hour. The Mayor came out from the conference
with an important air, and, on his way
home, stopped at Alderman Johnstone's door.
The poems, placards, and posters were still
prominently displayed, and over the way James
Roberts, in his well-worn coat, paced up and
down on his unwearying patrol. He would
wait days rather than miss Dale, in case the
poet might chance to pass that way. He had
nothing to do, for no one sent for him now;
he had no money, and could earn none; therefore
his time was his own, and he chose to
spend it thus, forgetting his wife and his child,
forgetting even to ask how it happened that
there was still food and fuel in his house, or to
suspect what made him so often see Philip
Hume walk past with an inquiring gaze, indifferently
concealed, and so often meet Dale's servant,
Wilson, carrying baskets up and down the
street on his way to and from Littlehill.</p>

<p>The Mayor went in and fell into conversation
with Johnstone. He spoke of the glories of
the coming day, of his own new gown, and of
Mrs. Hedger's; and as he raised his voice in
enthusiastic description Mrs. Johnstone stole in
from the back parlor and stood within the door.
The Alderman affected scorn of the whole
affair, and chuckled maliciously when the
Mayor referred to Dale Bannister.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Mayor, "after the Institoot's
opened, there's a grand luncheon at the
Grange, with the Duke, and his Lordship, and
the Squire, and all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused: the Alderman whistled indifferently,
and his wife drew a step nearer. The
Mayor proceeded, bringing his finest rhetoric
into play.</p>

<p>"The Crown," he said, "the County, and the
Town will be represented."</p>

<p>"What, are you going, Hedger?" asked the
Alderman, with an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>"The Squire and Mrs. Delane are so good as
to make a point of me and Mrs. Hedger attendin'&mdash;in
state, Johnstone."</p>

<p>"My!" said Mrs. Johnstone, moving a step
within the door. "That'll be a day for Susan."</p>

<p>"His Lordship gives Susan his arm," said
the Mayor.</p>

<p>"Aint there any more going from the town?"
asked Mrs. Johnstone, while the Alderman
ostentatiously occupied himself with one of his
posters.</p>

<p>"The Squire," replied the Mayor, "did want
another,&mdash;there's no room but for two,&mdash;but he
thinks there's no one of sufficient standin'&mdash;not
as would go."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure!" said Mrs. Johnstone.</p>

<p>"You see, ma'am," pursued the Mayor, "we
must consider the lady. The lady must be
asked. Now would <i>you</i> ask Mrs. Maggs, or
Mrs. Jenks, or Mrs. Capper, or any o' that lot,
ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Sakes, no!" said Mrs. Johnstone scornfully.</p>

<p>"'There is a lady,' I says to the Squire, 'as
would do honor to the town, but there&mdash;the
man's wrong there!'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Johnstone came nearer still, glancing at
her husband.</p>

<p>"When I mentioned the party I was thinkin'
of," the Mayor went on, "the Squire slapped
his thigh, and, says he, 'The very man we want,
Hedger,' he says; 'all parties ought to be
represented. He's a Liberal&mdash;a prominent
Liberal; so much the better. Now, won't he
come?' 'Well,' says I, 'he's an obstinate man;'
and Mrs. Delane says, 'You must try, Mr.
Mayor. Say what pleasure it 'ud give me to
see him and Mrs. Johnstone&mdash;&mdash;' There, I've
let it out!"</p>

<p>A pause followed. The Mayor drew a card
from his pocket. It was headed, "To have the
honor of meeting H. R. H. the Duke of Mercia."
The Mayor laid it on the counter.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "You must do as you
think right, Johnstone. Of course, if you like
to go on like this, worryin' the Squire's friends,
why, it isn't for you to put your legs under
the Squire's ma'ogany. So the Squire says.
He says, 'Let him drop that nonsense, and
come and be friendly&mdash;he may think what he
likes.'"</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>"There'll have been nothin' like it in my
day," said the Mayor. "And only me and
Susan from the town!"</p>

<p>"There'll be plenty ready to go," said Johnstone.</p>

<p>"Aye, that they will, but they won't have the
askin'. Mrs. Delane says there aint a soul
she'll have, except me and Susan, and you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Mrs. Johnstone. You see, ma'am, it isn't
everyone who can sit down with the county."</p>

<p>The heart of Mrs. Johnstone was alight with
pride and exultation and longing. She looked
at her husband and she looked at the Mayor.</p>

<p>"You and me and the Recorder 'ud drive up
in the coach," said the Mayor, with the air of
one who regretfully pictures an impossible
ideal; "and the ladies&mdash;Mrs. Hedger and you,
ma'am&mdash;was to follow in a carriage and pair
with a postilion&mdash;his Lordship 'ud send one
for ye."</p>

<p>"I'd wear my ruby velvet," murmured Mrs.
Johnstone in the voice of soliloquy, "and my
gold earrings."</p>

<p>"Well, I must be goin'," said the Mayor.
"It's a cryin' shame you won't come, Johnstone.
What's that mad feller Roberts to
you?"</p>

<p>"A dirty villain as starves his wife!" ejaculated
Mrs. Johnstone, with sudden violence.</p>

<p>The Alderman looked up with a start.</p>

<p>"Take a day to think it over," said the
Mayor. "Take a day, ma'am;" and he disappeared
with a smile on his shrewd, good-tempered
face.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment after he
went. The Alderman sat in his chair, glancing
at his wife out of the corner of his eye. Mrs.
Johnstone gazed fixedly at the shop-window.
The Alderman looked at her again: she was, he
thought (with much justice), a fine woman;
she would look well in the ruby velvet and the
gold earrings, and the swells would wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
where old Johnstone picked up that strapping
young woman&mdash;for she was his junior by
twenty years. The Alderman sighed, and
looked down again at his poster.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Johnstone stole quietly toward
the window, the Alderman covertly watching
her. When she reached it, she threw a coquettish
glance over her shoulder at her elderly husband:
did she not know, as well as he, that she
was a fine young woman?</p>

<p>Then she began to take Dale Bannister's
books out of their place, piling them behind the
counter, and to tear down the bills and placards.
The Alderman sat and watched her, till she
had finished her task. Then he rose and
thundered:</p>

<p>"Put them things back, Sally! Do you 'ear
<i>me?</i> I aint going to be made a fool of."</p>

<p>Probably Mrs. Johnstone was not so sure.
She burst into tears and flung her arms round
the Alderman's neck.</p>

<p>"There! what's there to cry about?" said
he, drawing her on to his knee.</p>

<p>While the Mayor was still in the shop, James
Roberts had gone home to his midday meal.
He ate it with good appetite, not knowing who
had paid for it, and not noticing his wife's
terror lest he should ask her. After the meal
he went to his study and read some of Dale's
poetry, declaiming it loudly and with fury, while
Ethel listened with the horror that had begun
to gain on her increasing and increasing as she
listened. She was afraid of him now&mdash;afraid
most for him, but also for the child and herself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and she thanked Heaven every time he
went out peacefully, and again when he came
back unhurt.</p>

<p>It was about four when the Doctor took his
hat and walked down the street to resume his
patrol. To his amazement, the window was
bare, the books gone, the placards and posters
all torn down. With an oath he rushed into
the shop, and found the Alderman sitting behind
a pile of volumes, on the top of which lay
an envelope addressed to himself.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" gasped the
Doctor, and as he spoke the glass door which
led to the parlor opened a little way.</p>

<p>"It means, Doctor, that I've had enough of
it."</p>

<p>"Enough of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Bannister aint done me any
'arm, and I'm not going to fret him any
more."</p>

<p>"You scoundrel!" shrieked the maddened
man; "you thief! you took my money&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's your books, and there in the envelope
you'll find your 'undred pound. Take 'em
and get out."</p>

<p>"So Bannister has been at you?" sneered
Roberts.</p>

<p>"I aint seen 'im."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>He was quiet now, the cold fit was on him.
He took no notice of the books, but put the
envelope in his pocket and turned to go,
saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"You think you can stop my revenge, you
pitiful fool; you'll see."</p>

<p>Johnstone gave himself a shake.</p>

<p>"I'm well out of that," he said. "I b'lieve
he's crazy. Sally, where are you?"</p>

<p>Sally came, and no doubt the Alderman
gained the reward of the righteous, in whose
house there is peace.</p>

<p>When the Squire received an acceptance of
his invitation from Alderman and Mrs. Johnstone,
he became more than ever convinced
that every Radical was at heart a snob. Perhaps
it would have been fair to remember that
most of them are husbands. Be that as it may,
his scheme had worked. The posters, the
books, and the sandwich-men were gone.
There was nothing now to remind Denborough
that it harbored a revolutionist. What was
more important still, there was nothing to
remind Dale Bannister of the indiscretions of
his past. He might now read his ode, unblushing,
in High Street, and no placard would
scream in ill-omened reminder: "No more
Kings!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Well-Paid Poem.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Among the quieter satisfactions of life
must be ranked in a high place the
peace of a man who has made up his
mind. He is no longer weighing perplexing
possibilities, but, having chosen his
path, feels that he has done all that can be
done, and that this conviction will enable him
to bear with patience the outcome of his determination,
whatever it may be. Of course he is
wrong, and if misfortune comes, his philosophy
will go to the wall, but for the moment it seems
as if fate cannot harm him, because he has set
his course and bidden defiance to it.</p>

<p>Dale had made up his mind to disregard
cavilers, not to write the Radical ditty, to write
the ode of welcome, and, lastly, to follow whither
his inclination led. And, on the top of these
comforting resolutions, came the removal of his
thorn in the flesh&mdash;Johnstone's be-placarded
shop window&mdash;and the glow of well-rewarded
benevolence with which he had witnessed Nellie
Fane's ill-concealed delight in her return to
Littlehill and Arthur Angell's openly declared
pleasure in greeting her. Dale began to think
that he had too easily allowed himself to be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
out, and had been false to his poetic temperament
by taking trifles hardly. He was jocund
as he walked, and nature responded to his
mood: the sun shone bright and warm on him,
and the spring air was laden with pleasant hints
of coming summer. He wondered how and
why, a few weeks ago, he had nearly bidden a
disgusted farewell to Market Denborough.</p>

<p>Now, when a man sets out in such a mood,
being a young man, and a man, as they used to
say, of sensibility, next to anything may happen.
From his contented meditations on the happy
arrangement he had made for his friends, Dale's
thoughts traveled on to his own affairs. He
was going to the Grange&mdash;he was always going
to the Grange now, and he seemed always welcome
there. Mrs. Delane was kind, the Squire
was effusive, and Janet&mdash;&mdash; Here his thoughts
became impossible to record in lowly prose.
The goddess had become flesh for him; still
stately and almost severe in her maiden reserve
to all others, as she had once been to him, now
for him she smiled and blushed, and would
look, and look away, and look again, and vainly
summon her tamed pride to hide what her
delight proclaimed. It was sudden. Oh, yes;
anything worth having was sudden, thought
lucky Dale. Fame had been sudden, wealth
had been sudden. Should not love be sudden
too?</p>

<p>"If I get a chance&mdash;&mdash;" said Dale to himself,
and he smiled and struck at the weeds with his
stick, and hummed a tune. Anything might
happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince was due in three days, and already
flags and triumphal arches were beginning to
appear. It is to be hoped that the demand for
drugs was small, for Mr. Hedger was to be
found everywhere but behind his own counter,
and Alderman Johnstone, having once taken
the plunge, was hardly less active in superintending
the preparations. The men who had
carried those obnoxious boards were now more
worthily earning their bread by driving in posts
and nailing up banners, and Dale saw that
Denborough was in earnest, and meant to make
the reception a notable testimony to its loyalty.
He loitered to watch the stir for a little while,
for it was early afternoon, and he must not
arrive at the Grange too soon. Not even the
ode itself, which he carried in his pocket, could
excuse an intrusion on the Squire's midday
repose. As he stood looking on he was
accosted by Dr. Spink.</p>

<p>"I have just been to see Roberts," he said.</p>

<p>"Is he ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His wife sent for me. As you may
suppose, she would not have done so for
nothing."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I don't like his state at all. He took no
notice of me, but lay on his bed, muttering to
himself. I think he's a little touched here;"
and the doctor put a finger just under the brim
of his well-brushed hat.</p>

<p>"Poor chap!" said Dale. "I should like to
go and see him."</p>

<p>Spink discouraged any such idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're the very last person he ought to see.
I want him to go away."</p>

<p>"Has he got any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. His wife told me he had
now."</p>

<p>"And won't he go?"</p>

<p>"He says he must stay till after the 15th"&mdash;the
15th was the great day&mdash;"and then he will
go. That's the only word I could get out of
him. I told his wife to let me know at once if
there was any change for the worse."</p>

<p>"It's hard on her, poor little woman," said
Dale, passing on his way.</p>

<p>He found Tora Smith and Sir Harry at the
Grange. Rather to his surprise, Tora greeted
him with friendly cordiality, accepting his congratulations
very pleasantly. He had expected
her to show some resentment at his refusal to
write a song for her, but in Tora's mind songs
and poets, Liberal meetings, and even royal
visits, had been, for the time at least, relegated
to a distant background of entire unimportance.
Captain Ripley was there also, with the ill-used
air that he could not conceal, although he was
conscious that it only aggravated his bad fortune.
He took his leave a very few minutes after Dale
arrived; for what pleasure was there in looking
on while everybody purred over Dale, and told
him his ode was the most magnificent tribute
ever paid to a youthful Prince? Dale, in his
heart, thought the same,&mdash;so does a man love
what he creates,&mdash;but he bore his compliments
with a graceful outward modesty.</p>

<p>The afternoon was so unseasonably fine&mdash;such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
was the reason given&mdash;that Janet and he
found themselves walking in the garden, she
talking merrily of their preparations, he watching
her fine, clear-cut profile, and, as she turned
to him in talk, the gay dancing of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Your doing it," she said, "just makes the
whole thing perfect. How can we thank you
enough, Mr. Bannister?"</p>

<p>"The Captain did not seem to care about my
verses," Dale remarked, with a smile.</p>

<p>Janet blushed a little, and gave him a sudden
glance&mdash;a glance that was a whole book of
confidences, telling what she never could have
told in words, what she never would have told
at all, did not the eyes sometimes outrun their
mandate and speak unbidden of the brain.</p>

<p>Dale smiled again&mdash;this time in triumph.</p>

<p>"You like them?" he asked softly, caressing
the little words with his musical, lingering
tones.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes," she said, looking at him once
more for a moment, and then hastily away.</p>

<p>"I'll write you a volume twice as good, if&mdash;I
may."</p>

<p>"Twice as good?" she echoed, with a laugh.
"Now, honestly, don't you think these perfect
yourself?"</p>

<p>"They are good&mdash;better than any I wrote
before"&mdash;he paused to watch her face, and
went on in a lower voice: "I knew you; but I
shall do better the more I know you and the
better."</p>

<p>Janet had no light answer ready now. Her
heart was beating, and she had much ado not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to bid him end her sweet, unbearable excitement.</p>

<p>They had reached the end of the terrace and
passed into the wood that skirted it to the west.
Suddenly she made a movement as if to turn
and go back.</p>

<p>"No, no," he whispered in her ear; and, as
she wavered, he caught her by the arm, and,
without words of asking or of doubt, drew her
to him and kissed her.</p>

<p>"My beauty, my queen, my love!" he whispered.
"You love me, you love me!"</p>

<p>She drew back her head, straightening the
white column of her neck, while her hands held
his shoulders. "Ah, I would die for you!" she
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane was a woman of penetration.
Though Janet told her nothing of what had
occurred,&mdash;for she and Dale agreed to let the
matter remain a secret till the impending
festivities were over,&mdash;yet Mrs. Delane saw
something in her daughter's air which made
her, that same evening, express to the Squire
her doleful conviction that the worst had happened.</p>

<p>"I shall say nothing to Janet," she said, "till
she speaks to me. I can trust her absolutely.
But I am afraid of it, George. Poor Gerard
Ripley!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm not going to break my heart
about Gerard Ripley. I think more of Jan."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, so do I. And I don't at all
like it. He's not&mdash;well, not our <i>sort</i>, as the
young people say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mary, you're talking slang. What's the
matter with him? The match will make Jan
famous."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I don't like it, but you must
have your way."</p>

<p>"It's not my way. It's Jan's way. Is she
fond of him?"</p>

<p>"Terribly, I'm afraid, poor child!"</p>

<p>The Squire became a little irritated at this
persistently sorrowful point of view.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear, why shouldn't she be fond
of him? It's not a bad thing when people are
going to marry."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd seen it in time to stop it."</p>

<p>"On the whole, Mary, I'm rather glad you
didn't. I like the young fellow."</p>

<p>In this state of things&mdash;with the lady eagerly
consenting, and a father all but ready to urge
her on&mdash;well might Captain Ripley ride recklessly
home from Dirkham Grange, cursing the
ways of women and the folly of men, and promising
himself to go to India and there be
killed, to the end that his tragic fate might
bring a pang to Janet's heart in future days.
Well might he discover a sudden recall, and
return to his regiment, escaping the Denborough
celebrations, and risking offense in exalted
quarters. So he went; and nobody at Denborough
thought any more about him&mdash;not
even Janet, for joy swallows up pity, and the
best of humanity are allowed, without reproach,
to be selfish once or twice in life.</p>

<p>That same night, at dinner at Littlehill,
Nellie Fane thought Dale had never been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
bright, so brilliant, or so merry. Under his
leadership, the fun and mirth waxed fast and
furious, till it carried away her doubts and fears,
and Angell's sore wonderings why she looked
always at Dale and never at him, and Philip's
troubled forebodings of sorrows no friendly
hand could avert. Dale's high spirits bore no
check and suffered no resistance, and there was
a tumult in Littlehill, such as had not been
heard since its early indecorous days.</p>

<p>Suddenly, into this scene, followed hastily by
Wilson, there broke, hatless and cloakless,
Ethel Roberts, her face pale and her eyes wide
with fear. Running to Philip Hume, she
cried:</p>

<p>"My husband! He has gone, he has gone!
We cannot find him. He has gone, and taken
the pistol with him. What shall I do? Oh,
what shall I do?"</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>An Evening's End.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">The next morning, Roberts' friends
held an anxious conference. The
Doctor, being left alone while his wife
went out on household affairs, had, it
seemed, risen from bed, dressed himself, and
left the house. He had taken a few pounds,
part of what Johnstone had returned to him,
but no luggage. Nothing was gone except his
revolver, which had lain on the mantelpiece,
his wife having feared to take it away. In the
absence of other explanation, it seemed most
probable that he had suddenly determined to
return to London, and Dr. Spink thought London
the best place to look for him. Accordingly,
Philip Hume at once started in pursuit;
for all felt, though none of them liked to express
the feeling, that Roberts was not in a
state in which he could safely be trusted to
look after himself. His wife was helpless with
grief and bewilderment, and kindly Mrs. Hodge
determined to spend the day with her, and
return to Littlehill only late in the evening;
thus at least proper attention would be secured
to the helpless child and its hardly less helpless
mother.</p>

<p>Not even these troubles could keep Dale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
from the Grange, and after dinner, with an
apology to Nellie and Arthur, he announced his
intention of strolling over to ask the Squire at
what point in the proceedings his ode was to
come. Nellie had a letter to write, or said she
had, and Arthur Angell offered to bear Dale
company part of the way, with a cigar.</p>

<p>The two men set out together, and Arthur
did not leave his friend till they were at the
Grange drive. Then he sauntered back, humming
snatches of song between his puffs of
smoke, and rejoicing in the glory of a full
moon. He had almost reached the gate of
Littlehill, when, to his surprise, he saw, a few
yards from him, a figure that seemed familiar.
He caught sight of it only for a moment, for
the trees then came between; and yet he felt
almost sure that the stealthily moving form was
that of James Roberts. He stood watching to
see him again, but he did not; and, going into
the house, he told Nellie what he thought he
had seen.</p>

<p>"Dr. Roberts going toward the Grange!"
she exclaimed. "You must be mistaken."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. It looked like him."</p>

<p>Nellie was not inclined to think he could be
right, but she agreed that Arthur had better go
and tell Dr. Spink of his suspicions. Arthur
went off on his errand, and she sat by the fire
alone.</p>

<p>Abandoning herself to reverie, she idly and
sadly reviewed the events of the days since her
return. How joyfully she had come! But it
had hardly been as good as she hoped. Dale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
was very kind, when he was there. But why
did he leave her so much&mdash;leave her to Arthur
Angell? And ah, why did he go so much to
the Grange? It was all far pleasanter before
he came to Denborough, before he knew these
great people&mdash;yes, and before this Dr. Roberts
was there to worry them. The thought of
Roberts carried her mind in a new direction.
What a strange man he was! And his poor
wife! She could not think why he had become
so odd and so unfriendly. Yet it was so. He
seemed absolutely to hate Dale; she had seen
him look at him so fiercely. Dale had not
ruined him; he had ruined himself. He was
mad to blame Dale. Ah, wasn't he mad?&mdash;She
sat up suddenly in her chair. What if
Arthur were right? What if it were he? Why
was he going to the Grange! Dale was there.
What was that they said about a pistol? Ah&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Without another thought she rose, and as
she was, in her evening dress and thin shoes,
she ran out of the house and along the wooded
road toward the Grange. A terrible idea was
goading her on. He was mad; he hated Dale;
he had a revolver with him. Oh, could she be
in time? They would wonder at her. What
did that matter? Her love, her lord was&mdash;or
might be&mdash;in danger. She pressed on, till she
panted and had to pause; then, with breath but
half recovered, over rough and smooth ground,
knowing no difference, she sped on her way.</p>

<p>Dale's talk with the Squire was not long; but
the Squire's daughter came to the door to bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
him good-night, and was easily persuaded to
walk a little way down the drive with him. She
went farther than she meant, as was natural
enough; for she was leaning on his arm, and he
was telling her, in that caressing voice of his,
that all his life and heart and brain and power
were hers, and lavishing sweet words on her.</p>

<p>"I must go back, Dale," she said. "They
will wonder what has become of me."</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must."</p>

<p>"Ah, my darling, how soon will it be when
we need never part? How soon? I mean
how long, till then! Do you love me?"</p>

<p>"You know, Dale."</p>

<p>"What was it you said the other day&mdash;was it
only yesterday?&mdash;that you would die for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah, Jan, my sweetest Jan, that you should
say that to me!"</p>

<p>They said no more, but did not part yet. At
last he suffered her to tear herself away.</p>

<p>"I shall run back through the shrubbery," she
whispered.</p>

<p>"I shall wait."</p>

<p>"Yes, wait. When I get in, I will show you
a light from my window. A good-night light,
Dale."</p>

<p>She sped away down a side-path, and Dale
leaned against a tree, in the moonlight, fixing
his lovelorn eyes on the window.</p>

<p>As Janet turned down her path, she rushed,
in her rapid flight, against a man who stood
there in lurking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Dale's side was to him, but he was watching
Dale, with a sneering smile on his lips. When
she saw him, she started back. In a moment
he seized her shoulder with one hand, and
pressed a pistol to her head.</p>

<p>"If you make a sound, I'll kill you," he
hissed. "Don't stir&mdash;don't scream."</p>

<p>She was paralyzed with surprise and fright.
It was Roberts, and&mdash;what did he mean?</p>

<p>He pushed her slowly before him, the revolver
still at her head, till they reached the drive.
Dale's eyes were set on his mistress' window,
and their feet made no noise on the grass-edges
of the drive. Roberts gave a low laugh, and
whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>"He came to see you, did he? The traitor!
Not a sound! Wait till he turns! wait till he
turns! I want him to see me. When he turns,
I shall shoot him."</p>

<p>At last she understood. The madman meant
to kill Dale.</p>

<p>He would kill him, before Dale could defend
himself. She must warn him&mdash;at any cost, she
must warn him. If it cost her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not a sound," hissed Roberts. "A sound
and you are dead; your head blown to bits&mdash;blown
to bits!" And again he laughed, but
noiselessly.</p>

<p>It was her life against his. Ah, she must
warn him&mdash;she must cry out! But the cold
barrel pressed against her temple, and the madman's
voice hissed in her ear:</p>

<p>"Blown to bits&mdash;blown to bits!"</p>

<p>She couldn't die, she couldn't die! not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
that&mdash;not blown to bits! Perhaps he would
miss; Dale might escape. She couldn't die!</p>

<p>He advanced a little nearer, keeping on the
grass-edge and pushing her before him, still
whispering to her death and its horrors, if she
made a sound. It was too horrible; she could
not bear it. Ah! he was measuring the distance.
She must cry out! She opened her lips.
Quick as thought, he pressed the barrel to her
head. She could not, could not do it; and,
with a groan, she sank, a senseless heap, on the
ground at his feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out, and a woman's
cry. Dale started from his reverie, to see a
woman a step or two from him; a woman,
tottering, swaying, falling forward on her face,
as he rushed to support her in his arms.</p>

<p>There was a shout of men's voices, and, following
on it, another report, and James Roberts
fell beside Janet Delane, his head, as he had
said, blown to bits; and two panting men, who
had run all the way from Denborough, were
raising Janet and looking if she were dead, and
then laying her down again and turning to
where Nellie Fane lay in lifeless quiet in Dale's
arms.</p>

<p>"A minute sooner and we should have been
in time," said Arthur Angell to Dr. Spink, as
the Doctor pushed Dale aside and knelt over
Nellie.</p>

<p>And Dale, relieved, ran at all his speed to
where Janet lay and threw himself on his knees
beside her.</p>

<p>"My love, open your eyes," he cried.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>"The Other Girl Did."</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">On the afternoon of the morrow, Philip
Hume, who, summoned by a telegram
from Dr. Spink, had come down to
Denborough by the first train he
could catch, put on his hat, and, lighting his
pipe, took a turn up and down the road that
ran by Littlehill. Since his coming he had
been in the house, and the house had seemed
almost to stifle him. He had a man's feeling
of uselessness in the face of a sick room; he
could do nothing to help Nellie Fane in her
struggle for life; he only hindered the people
who could do something. Nor did he succeed
much better with those whose ailments were
of the mind. Arthur Angell sat in one room,
suspecting now that, whether Nellie lived or
died, his dearest hopes were dead. Dale, in
another room, strode unrestingly to and fro,
waiting for Wilson to come back from the
messages he kept sending him on, now upstairs
to Nellie's door, now down the town to
Ethel Roberts', now, and most often, to the
Grange; and always Wilson, his forehead wet
and his legs weary, came back and said:</p>

<p>"Please, sir, there is no change."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Once Nellie had been conscious, had asked
"Is he safe?" and, receiving her answer, had
closed her eyes again. Ethel Roberts was in
no danger; the shock would pass. Of Janet
there came no news, save that she was alone
with her mother, and cried to be alone even
from her mother. James Roberts, in his
frenzy, had indeed wrought havoc, and Philip,
as he walked and smoked, vehemently, though
silently, cursed the ways of this world.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Hodge came out in her
bonnet.</p>

<p>"Nellie is well looked after," she said. "I
am going down to see how that poor little
Roberts is."</p>

<p>Philip did not offer to go with the good
woman. He watched her heavy figure hastening
down the hill, wondering that she seemed
almost happy in her busy services of kindness.
He could do nothing but fret, and smoke, and
try to keep out of the way.</p>

<p>A smart brougham drove up. It stopped
by him, and Tora Smith jumped out.</p>

<p>"How is she?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Spink thinks she will pull through," answered
Philip; "but of course she's in great
danger still."</p>

<p>"May I go to her?" asked Tora.</p>

<p>"She sees no one," he replied in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean to see her. I mean to
stay and help&mdash;to nurse her, you know."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you: she has her mother
and a nurse."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't you let me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"It does not rest with me. But why should
you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I once thought such horrid things of her.
And&mdash;wasn't it splendid?"</p>

<p>Philip looked kindly at her.</p>

<p>"That will please her," he said, "and her
friends."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I help?"</p>

<p>"I tell you what: poor Mrs. Roberts has no
one but a hired nurse. Mrs. Hodge has run
down for a minute, but of course she can't
leave her daughter long."</p>

<p>"You mean I ought to go to her?"</p>

<p>"One can't even be kind in the way one likes
best," said Philip.</p>

<p>"Well, I will. But I should have loved to
be with Miss Fane. I can't tell you how I
feel about her. I think people who think evil
things of other people ought to be <i>beaten</i>, Mr.
Hume."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, but justice flags. You can't
expect me to beat you, Miss Smith."</p>

<p>Tora smiled for a minute; then she wiped
her eyes again, and asked gravely:</p>

<p>"Are you never serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am serious now. Go to that poor
woman; consider doing that in the light of a
beating."</p>

<p>"You'll let Miss Fane know I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; and Dale. What a terrible facer for
our celebrations, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Harry has ridden over to see Lord
Cransford about it. Mr. Delane wants the
thing put off, if possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you put off a Prince? But I suppose
he'll be only too glad not to be bored
with it."</p>

<p>"You know Janet is in a dreadful state?
Poor girl! It must have been awful for her.
The man had hold of her! Well, I shall go.
Good-by. I shall run up here again to-morrow."</p>

<p>The putting off of the Prince, in spite of
Philip's doubt of its constitutional possibility,
was managed: for the ceremony could hardly
take place without Mr. Delane's presence, as
he had been the inspiring force of the whole
movement which had resulted in the Institute;
and Mr. Delane felt it utterly out of the question
for him to take any part in such festivities,
in view of the dreadful occurrence in his
grounds and of his daughter's serious condition.
The doctors, indeed, told him that she had
stood the shock remarkably well; they would
not have been surprised to find her much worse.
Her reason was unshaken, and, after the first
night anyhow, the horror of the madman's grip
and voice had left her. She did not, waking
or sleeping, for she slept sometimes, dream
that she was again in his hands, face to face
with death; and Dr. Spink congratulated the
Squire and Mrs. Delane on a good prospect of
a total recovery. Yet Mrs. Delane and the
Squire were not altogether comforted. For
Janet lay from morning to evening on her bed,
almost motionless and very quiet, whenever
anyone was in the room. She asked once or
twice after her fellow-sufferers, but, except for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
that, and answering questions, she never spoke
but to say:</p>

<p>"I think I could sleep if I were alone."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Delane would go away, trying to
believe the excuse.</p>

<p>There are not many of us who would feel
warranted in being very hard on a man who had
failed in such a trial as had befallen Janet Delane:
in a woman, failure would seem little
other than a necessary consequence of her sex.
Death, sudden, violent, and horrible, searches
the heart too closely for anyone to feel sure that
his would be found sound to the core&mdash;not risk
of death, for that most men will, on good cause
and, even more cheerfully, in good company,
meet and face. It is certainty that appalls; and
it had been certain death that had awaited
Janet's first cry. And yet she would not be
comforted. She had stopped to think how
certain it was; then she failed. The mistake
was in stopping to think at all. The other girl&mdash;the
girl he did not love, but who, surely, loved
him with a love that was love indeed&mdash;had not
stopped to think whether the bullet could or
might or must hit her. She had not cared
which; it had been enough for her that it
might hit the man she loved, unless she stood
between to stop it, and she had stood between.
How could Janet excuse her cowardice by telling
herself of the certainty of death, when, had
she not been a coward, she would never have
stayed to know whether death were certain or
not? If she ever could have deluded herself
like that, what the other girl did made it impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
The other girl&mdash;so she always thought
of Nellie&mdash;held up a mirror wherein Janet saw
her own littleness. And yet he had loved her,
not the other; her life belonged to him, the
other's did not; she had proclaimed proudly,
but an instant before, that she would die for him,
and he had praised her for saying it. He would
know now what her protestations were worth.
He would be amused to think that it was not
Janet Delane&mdash;the Janet who was always exhorting
him to noble thoughts&mdash;who was proud
in the pride of her race&mdash;not she who had dared
death for him; but that other, so far beneath
her, whom she had not deigned to think a rival.
Ah, but why, why had she not called? Surely
God would have given her one moment to be
glad in, and that would have been enough.</p>

<p>She sat up in bed, the coverings falling from
her, and her black hair streaming over her white
night-dress. Clasping her hands over her
knees, she looked before her out of the window.
She could see the tree where Dale had stood
and the spot where she had fallen; she could
see the fresh red gravel, put down to hide the
stains, and the gardener's rake, flung down
where he had used it. He must have gone to
tea&mdash;gone to talk it all over with his wife and
his friends, to wonder why Miss Janet had not
called out, why she had left it to the other girl,
why she had fainted, while the other had saved
him. They would talk of "poor Miss Janet,"
and call the other a "rare plucked 'un"&mdash;she
knew their way. Nobody would ever call her
that&mdash;not her father again, who used to boast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
that Janet, like all his house, feared nothing but
dishonor, and would make as good a soldier as
the son he had longed for in vain. Her mother
had come and called her "a brave girl." Why
did people think there was any good in lies?
She meant it kindly, but it was horrible to hear
it. Lies are no use. Let them call her a
coward, if they wanted to speak the truth.
They all thought that. Dale thought it; Dale,
who must be admiring that other girl's gallantry,
and wondering why he had not loved
her, instead of loving a girl who talked big, and,
when danger came, fainted&mdash;and stood by to
see him die.</p>

<p>Of course he could not go on loving her after
this. He would feel, everybody must feel,
that he owed his life to the girl who had saved
him, and must give it to her. Very likely he
would come and pretend to want her still. He
would think it right to do that, though it would
really be kinder just to let her drop. She would
understand. Nobody knew he had spoken to
her; perhaps nobody need; it would not seem
so bad to people who did not know she
had promised to be his wife. Not that it mattered
much what people thought. She knew
what she was, and&mdash;she must let him go,
she must let him go. And here, for the first
time, she buried her head in her pillow and
sobbed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane came in.</p>

<p>"Why, Janet dearest, you've nothing over
you! You'll catch cold. What's the matter,
darling? Are you frightened?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>There it was! Everybody thought she was
frightened now.</p>

<p>"There is a message from Mr. Bannister,
darling. He wants so much to see you, and
the doctor thinks it would do you no harm.
Do you think you could dress and see him?"</p>

<p>"He wants to see me?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, dear. Of course, Jan. I know,
my dear."</p>

<p>"To leave her and come and see me?"</p>

<p>"Miss Fane? Oh, she's going on very well.
There's no reason he shouldn't come over here.
You would like to see him, Jan?"</p>

<p>"Tell him to go away&mdash;tell him to go to her&mdash;tell
him to leave me alone."</p>

<p>"But, Jan, dearest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, mamma, do leave me alone!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delane went and told the messenger
that Miss Delane might see no one for a day or
two; she was still too agitated. Then she
sought her husband and told him of their
daughter's words.</p>

<p>"She must be a little queer still," said the
Squire, with anxiety. "Don't be worried, Mary.
She's a strong girl, and she'll soon throw it off."</p>

<p>But she could not throw it off&mdash;not that
thought which had burned into her breast; and
all night, by the light of the moon, she sat and
looked at the tree and the fresh gravel, the spot
where her honor and her love had called on her,
and called in vain.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>The Fitness of Things.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">If anything could have consoled Market
Denborough for the certain postponement
and possible loss of the Duke of
Mercia's visit, it would have been the
cause of these calamities. Its citizens were not
more hard-hearted than other people, and they
bestowed much sympathy on Nellie Fane, who,
out of the competitors, was easily elected the
heroine of the incident; but neither were they
more impervious to the charms of excitement,
of gossip, and of notoriety. The reporters and
the artists who had been told off to describe
and depict the scene of the royal visit did not
abandon their journey, but substituted sketches
of the fatal spot, of the Grange, of Littlehill,
and of the actors in the tragedy; while interviews
with the Mayor, and anybody else who
knew, or knew someone who knew about the
circumstances, or professed to do either, amply
supplied the place which the pageant and the
speeches had been destined to fill. And if the
occurrence excited such interest in the great
London papers, the broadsheets and columns of
the local journals were a sight to behold. The
circulation of the <i>Standard</i> went up by more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
than a hundred; while the <i>Chronicle</i> announced,
it must be admitted to a somewhat
skeptical world, that its weekly issue had exhausted
three editions, and could no longer be
obtained at the booksellers' or the office. The
assertion, however, being untested, passed, and
everyone allowed that young Mingley's detailed
account of poor Roberts' last words to Dale
Bannister, before he fired, were perfect in verisimilitude,
which, under the regrettable circumstance
of Mingley's absence, and of no such
words having been uttered, was all that could
be expected. Mingley was puffed up, demanded
a rise of salary, got it, and married Polly Shipwright,
the young lady at the "Delane Arms."
So the ill wind blew Mingley good. Yet the
editor of the <i>Chronicle</i> was not satisfied, and as
a further result of Mingley's activity, he inserted
an article the following week, in which he
referred, with some parade of mystery, to the
romantic character of the affair. It was not only
in fiction, he remarked, that love had opportunities
for displaying itself in heroism, nor, it
was to be earnestly hoped, only in the brains of
imaginative writers that affection and gratitude
found themselves working together toward a
joyful consummation. Denborough knew and
admired its gifted fellow-townsman, and Denborough
had been a witness of the grace and
charm of the young lady who had shed such
luster on her sex. Accordingly, Denborough
waited the result with some confidence. Into
this personal side of the matter the <i>Standard</i>
did not try to follow its rival. Mr. Delane controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the <i>Standard</i>, and he forbade any such
attempt, on grounds of careful generality. But
the article in the <i>Chronicle</i> was quite enough;
it expressed what everyone had been thinking,
and very soon the whole town was expecting to
hear, simultaneously, that Nellie was out of
danger, and that she had given her hand to
Dale Bannister. The theory was so strongly
and unhesitatingly accepted that the two or
three who, mainly out of a love of paradox, put
their heads on one side and asked how Miss
Delane came to be out in the garden with Dale
Bannister, were pooh-poohed and told that they
merely showed their ignorance of the usages
of society; whereupon they went home and
grumbled to their wives, but were heard no
more in public places.</p>

<p>Dale Bannister flung the <i>Chronicle</i> down on
the table with a muttered oath, asking the
eternally-asked, never-to-be-answered question,
why people could not mind their own business&mdash;an
unjust query in this case, for it is a reporter's
business to mind other people's business. He
had just come down from his first interview
with Nellie. She was mending rapidly, and
was now conscious, although any reference to
the events of the fatal night was sternly forbidden;
he was not even allowed to thank the
friend who, happily, had only risked, not lost,
her life for him. He had whispered his joy at
finding her doing well, and she had pressed
his hand in answer; more than that vigilant
attendants prevented. Then he had come
downstairs, picked up the <i>Chronicle</i> in the hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
read the article, and gone into the smoking
room, where he had found Arthur Angell
sitting by the fire, his hands deep in his pockets
and his shoulders up to his ears, a picture of
woe.</p>

<p>"What infernal nonsense!" said Dale, with
a vexed laugh. "Do you see how this fellow
disposes of us, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw," said Arthur gloomily.</p>

<p>"I suppose they're bound to say that. The
public loves romance."</p>

<p>"I think it's very natural they should say it.
Why did she follow you? Why did she risk
her life? Why did she ask after you the first
moment she was conscious?"</p>

<p>"No one but me was being murdered," suggested
Dale, with a rather uneasy smile.</p>

<p>"We left her here. Why did she go out at
all? But it's too plain. I saw it before I had
been here a day."</p>

<p>"Saw what, man?" asked Dale, passing by
Arthur's questionable assertion.</p>

<p>"Why, that Nellie&mdash;you know. I don't know
what you feel, but I know what she feels. It's
rough on me having me down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never thought of such a thing," said Dale
quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose not; though how you
didn't&mdash;&mdash; I
say, now, before you came to
Denborough, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't think so. We were great
friends."</p>

<p>Arthur shook his head, and Dale poked the
little bit of fire in an impatient way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"How damned crooked things go!" he
said.</p>

<p>Arthur rose and said in a decided tone:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm out of it. She saved your life,
and she's in love with you. It seems to me
your duty's pretty plain. You must drop your
other fancy."</p>

<p>"My other fancy?" exclaimed Dale in horror.
Lived there a man who could call his love for
Janet a "fancy"?</p>

<p>"You'd break her heart," said Arthur, who
thought of no one but his lady-love in his
unselfish devotion.</p>

<p>It crossed Dale's mind to say that the situation
seemed to involve the breaking of one
heart at least, if Arthur were right; but he
thought he had no right to speak of Janet's
feelings, well as he knew them. He threw the
poker down with a clang.</p>

<p>"Take care&mdash;you'll disturb her."</p>

<p>This annoyed Dale.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," he remarked, "we're not
all, except you, entirely indifferent whether she
lives or dies. I might throw pokers about all
day&mdash;and I feel inclined to&mdash;without her hearing
me in the blue room."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg pardon," said Arthur, turning to
the window and looking out.</p>

<p>He saw a stout man coming up the hill. It
was the Mayor of Denborough, and he was
evidently making for Littlehill. When he was
ushered into the smoking room, he explained
that he had come to ask after Miss Fane's
progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"The town, Mr. Bannister, sir," he said, "is
takin' a great interest in the young lady."</p>

<p>"I am glad to say she has, we think, turned
the corner," said Dale.</p>

<p>"That's happy news for all&mdash;and you first of
all, sir."</p>

<p>The Mayor might merely have meant that
Dale's feelings would be most acute, as Nellie
had received her wound in his service; but
there was a disconcerting twinkle in the Mayor's
eye.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Roberts," the Mayor continued, "is
doin' first rate. After all, it's a riddance for
her, sir. Have you any news from the
Grange?"</p>

<p>"I hear there is no change in Miss Delane.
She still suffers from the shock."</p>

<p>"Poor young lady! I hear the Captain's
back at the Warren, sir."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Captain Ripley, sir. Back at home."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>The Mayor was bursting with suppressed
gossip on this point also, but the atmosphere
was most repressive. He looked round in
despair for another opening, and his eye fell
on Arthur Angell.</p>

<p>"Seen the <i>Chronicle</i>, sir?" he asked. "That
Mingley's a sharp young chap. Still I don't
'old&mdash;hold with all that talk about people.
Did you say you'd seen it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen it. It's mostly lies."</p>

<p>"He, he!" chuckled the Mayor. "You're
right, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>A long pause ensued before the Mayor very
reluctantly took his hat.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall see Miss Fane about soon,
sir?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so. I think so, if nothing goes
wrong."</p>

<p>"She must be proud and happy, that young
lady, sir. As I said to my daughters, says I:
'Now, girls, which of you is goin' to save your
young man's life?' And my wife, Mrs. Hedger,
sir, she put in: 'None of you, I'll be bound, if
you don't&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>The anecdote was lost, for Dale interrupted:</p>

<p>"Let me see you as far as the gate," and
pushed the Mayor's walking-stick into his
hand.</p>

<p>Having got rid of the Mayor, Dale did not
hasten to return to Arthur Angell. At this
moment, exasperated as he was, everything
about his friend annoyed him&mdash;his devotion, his
unselfishness, his readiness to accept defeat
himself, his indiscreet zeal on behalf of his mistress.
His despair for himself, and his exhortation
to Dale, joined in manifesting that he
neither possessed himself nor could understand
in another what a real passion was. If he did
or could, he would never have used that word
"fancy." How could people speak of friendship
or gratitude, or both together, as if they
were, or were in themselves likely to lead to,
love? You did not love a woman because you
esteemed her. If you loved her, you might
esteem her&mdash;or you might not; anyhow, you
worshiped her. Yet these peddling Denborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
folk were mapping out his course for him.
And Arthur Angell croaked about broken
hearts.</p>

<p>Suddenly a happy thought struck him, a
thought which went far to restore his equanimity.
These people, even that excellent Arthur,
spoke in ignorance. At the most, they&mdash;those
who knew anything&mdash;supposed that he had a
"fancy" for Janet. They had no idea that his
love had been offered and accepted, that he
was plighted to her by all the bonds of honor
and fidelity. This exacting gratitude they
harped upon might demand a change of nascent
inclinations; it would not require, nor even
justify, broken promises, and the flinging back
of what a man had asked for and received.
Dale's step grew more elastic and his face
brighter as he realized that, in reality, on a sane
view of the position, duty and pleasure went
hand in hand, both pointing to the desired goal,
uniting to free him from any such self-sacrifice
as Arthur Angell had indicated. If Arthur
were right about Nellie's feelings, and if he had
been a free man, he might have felt some obligation
on him, or at least have chosen, to make
the child happy, but as it was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must be just before I'm generous," he
said to himself, and added, with a shamefaced
laugh, "and I happen to like justice best."</p>

<p>At this moment a servant in the Grange
livery rode up, touching his hat, and handed
him a note. It was from Janet, though her writing
was so tremulous as to be scarcely recognizable.
He tore it open and read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p class="pq1 p1">You can never wish to see me again, but come once
more. It was not quite as bad as it seemed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J.</p>

<p class="p1">In bewilderment he turned to the man.</p>

<p>"Miss Delane sent this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Say I'll come over to the Grange to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>The man rode off, and Dale stood, fingering
and staring at his note.</p>

<p>"What does the dear girl mean?" he asked.
"What wasn't so bad? Why don't I wish to
see her again? Has that ruffian driven her out
of her senses?"</p>

<p>When Dr. Spink came that evening, Dale
seized the opportunity of sounding him. The
Doctor laughed at the idea of any serious
mental derangement.</p>

<p>"Miss Delane's very much upset, of course,
very much, but her mind is as right as yours or
mine."</p>

<p>"She's got no delusions?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no. She's nervous and over-strained,
that's all. She'll be all right in a few
days."</p>

<p>"Then," said Dale to himself, as the Doctor
bustled off, "all I can say is that I don't understand
women."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Morbid Scruple.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">Mrs. Delane had ceased to struggle
against the inevitable, and she hailed
her daughter's desire to see Dale Bannister
as an encouraging sign of a return
to a normal state of mind. Strange as
Janet's demeanor had been since that fearful
evening, there could not be anything seriously
wrong with her when her wishes and impulses
ran in so natural a channel. Mrs. Delane received
Dale with an approach to enthusiasm,
and sent him up to the little boudoir where
Janet was with an affectionate haste which in
itself almost amounted to a recognition of his
position.</p>

<p>"You must be gentle with her, please, Mr.
Bannister," she said. "She wanted so much to
see for herself that you were really alive that
we could not refuse to allow her, but the Doctor
is most strict in ordering that she should not
be excited."</p>

<p>Dale promised to be careful, and went upstairs
without a word about the strange note he
had received; that was a matter between Janet
and himself.</p>

<p>Janet was sitting, propped up with cushions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
on a low chair, and she waved Dale to a seat
near her. When, before sitting down, he came
to her and kissed her, she did not repel his
caress, but received it silently, again motioning
him to the chair. Dale knelt down on the floor
beside her.</p>

<p>"How pale you are, poor dear!" he said.
"And why do you write me such dreadful
things?"</p>

<p>"I wanted," she began in a low voice, "to
tell you, Dale, that I did try, that I really did
try, to call out. I did not forsake you without
trying."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, darling? How have
you forsaken me?"</p>

<p>"When he caught hold of me, there was
plenty of time to call out. I might have warned
you&mdash;I might have warned you. I might have
done what she did. But I couldn't. I tried,
but I couldn't. I was afraid. He said he
would blow my head to bits. I was afraid, and
I left her to save you."</p>

<p>"My dearest girl," he said, taking her hand,
"you did the only thing. If you had cried out,
he would have murdered you first and me afterward;
all the chambers of the revolver were
loaded. I would have died a thousand times
sooner than have one of your dear hairs roughened;
but, as it was, your death wouldn't have
saved me."</p>

<p>She had looked at him for a moment as if
with sudden hope, but, as he finished, she shook
her head and said:</p>

<p>"I didn't think anything about that. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
just afraid, and I should have let you be
killed."</p>

<p>"My sweet, who ever expected you to condemn
yourself to certain death on the chance of
saving me? It would be monstrous!"</p>

<p>"She did it," said Janet in low tones.</p>

<p>Dale paused for a minute.</p>

<p>"She was not in his clutches," he said. "He
might have missed her."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no!" she broke out suddenly.
"You run down what she did to spare me!
That's worst of all."</p>

<p>"Why, Jan, I don't say a word against her;
but there was a difference."</p>

<p>"She thought of no difference. She only
thought of you. I thought of my own life."</p>

<p>"Thank God if you did, dearest!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came. I wanted to tell you I
had tried."</p>

<p>"I need nothing to make me love you more,
my beauty and delight," he said, pressing her
to him.</p>

<p>She looked at him with a sort of amazement,
making a faint effort to push him away.</p>

<p>"It was so lucky," he went on, "that I didn't
see you, or I should have rushed at him, and
he would most likely have killed you. As it
was&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, for it seemed impossible
to speak of poor Nellie's hurt as a happy
outcome.</p>

<p>"Come," he resumed, "let's think no more
about it. The wretched man is dead and
Nellie Fane is getting better, and we&mdash;why, we,
Jan, have one another."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>With sudden impatience she rose, unlacing
his arms from about her.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" she cried. "Who is she?
Why should she give her life for you? I loved
you, and I was afraid. She wasn't afraid."</p>

<p>Dale thought that he began to understand
a little better. Jealousy was a feeling he had
read about, and seen, and written about. If Jan
were jealous, he could undertake to reassure
her.</p>

<p>"She's a very old and good friend of mine,"
he said, "and it was just like her brave, unselfish
way to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What had you done to make her love you
so?"</p>

<p>"My sweetest Jan, surely you can't think
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! I don't mean that. I'm
not so mean as that."</p>

<p>Dale wondered whether this passionate disclaimer
of jealousy did not come in part from
self-delusion, though he saw that Janet made it
in all genuineness.</p>

<p>"You have made her love you&mdash;oh, of course
you have! Why did she follow you? why did
she come between you and the shot? I loved
you, too, Dale. Ah! how I loved&mdash;how I
thought I loved you! But her love was greater
than mine."</p>

<p>"Come, Jan, come; you exaggerate. You
must be calm, dearest. Nellie and I are very
fond of one another, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know she loves you&mdash;you know she
loves you to death."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"My darling, I don't know anything of the
sort. But supposing she did&mdash;well, I am very
sorry, very deeply grieved if she is unhappy;
but I don't love her&mdash;or any other woman in
the world but you, Jan. If she had saved my
life a thousand times, it would make no difference.
You, Jan, you are the breath of my life
and the pulse of my blood."</p>

<p>He spoke with passion, for he was roused to
combat this strange idea that threatened all his
joy. As she stood before him, in her fairness
and distress, he forgot his searchings of heart,
his tenderness for Nellie, everything, except
that she, and she alone, was the woman to be
his, and neither another nor she herself should
prevent it.</p>

<p>Looking at him, she read this, or some of it,
in his eyes, for she shrank back from him, and,
clasping her hands, moaned:</p>

<p>"Don't, don't! You must go to her&mdash;you
belong to her. She saved you, not I. You are
hers, not mine."</p>

<p>"Jan, this is madness! She is nothing to
me; you are all the world."</p>

<p>"You must despise me," she said in a wondering
way, "and yet you say that!"</p>

<p>"If I did despise you, still it would be true.
But I worship you."</p>

<p>"I must not! I must not! You must go to
her. She saved you. Leave me, Dale, and go
back. You must not come again."</p>

<p>He burst out in wrath:</p>

<p>"Now, by God, I will not leave you or let
you go! Mine you are, and mine you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
be!" and he seized her by the wrist. She
gave a startled cry that recalled him to gentleness.</p>

<p>"Did I frighten you, my beauty? But it is
so, and it must be. It is sweet of you to offer&mdash;to
make much of what she did, and little of
yourself. I love you more for it. But we have
done with that now. Come to me, Jan."</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't! She would always be
between us; I should always see her between
us. O Dale, how can you leave her?"</p>

<p>"I have never loved her. I have never
promised her," he replied sternly. "It is all a
mere delusion. A man's love is not to be turned
by folly like this."</p>

<p>She answered nothing, and sank back in her
chair again.</p>

<p>"If it's jealousy," he went on, "it is unworthy
of you, and an insult to me. And if it's not
jealousy, it's mere madness."</p>

<p>"Can't you understand?" she murmured.
"How can I take what is hers?"</p>

<p>"I can take what is mine, and I will. You
gave yourself to me, and I will not let
you go."</p>

<p>Still she said nothing, and he tried gentleness
once more.</p>

<p>"Come, Jan, sweetest, you have made your
offering&mdash;your sweet, Quixotic self-sacrifice&mdash;and
it is not accepted! Say that's my want of
moral altitude, if you like. So be it. I won't
sacrifice myself."</p>

<p>"It's for her to take, not for you. I offer it
to her, not to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I don't offer it to her. Would she care
for such an offer? She may love me or not&mdash;I
don't know; but if she does, she will not take
my hand without my heart."</p>

<p>"You must love her. If you could love me,
how much more must you love her?"</p>

<p>"You are mad!" he answered, almost
roughly, "mad to say such a thing! I know
you love me, and I will not listen to it. Do
you hear? I shall come back and see you
again, and I will not listen to this."</p>

<p>She heard his imperious words with no sign
but a little shiver.</p>

<p>"There," he went on, "you are still ill. I'll
come back."</p>

<p>"No use," she murmured. "I can't, Dale."</p>

<p>"But you will, and you shall!" he cried.
"You shall see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened, and the nurse came in to
forbid his further lingering. With a distant
good-by, he left Janet motionless and pale, and,
hastening downstairs, went to the Squire's
room.</p>

<p>"I have come," he said abruptly, "to ask
your sanction to my engagement with your
daughter."</p>

<p>The Squire laid down his book.</p>

<p>"I'm not much surprised," he said, smiling.
"What does Jan say?"</p>

<p>Dale launched out into a history of the sweet
things Janet had said, and of the strange, wild
things she said now. The Squire heard of the
latter with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Very odd," he commented. "But it seems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
my dear fellow, that, for good reasons or bad,
at present she says No."</p>

<p>"She said Yes; she can't say No now," declared
Dale. "Do you consent, Mr. Delane?"</p>

<p>"If she does, my dear fellow. But I can't
help you in this matter."</p>

<p>"I want no help. She is not in her senses
now. I shall make an end of this folly. I will
not have it."</p>

<p>He went out as abruptly as he had rushed in,
leaving the Squire in some perplexity.</p>

<p>"A man of decision," he commented; "and,
altogether, a couple of rather volcanic young
people. They must settle it between themselves."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>The Heroine of the Incident.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">After Dale's visit to the Grange a few
days elapsed in a quiet that was far
from peaceful. Dale had gone to the
Grange the next day, and the day
after that: the sight of Janet had been denied
to him. He was told that his visit had left her
very agitated and upset, and the doctor was
peremptory in forbidding any repetition of it.
He had sent her a note, and she had returned
a verbal message by her mother that she did
not feel equal to writing. Was it possible that
she meant to abide by her insane resolve to
break off their engagement?</p>

<p>At Littlehill things were hardly more happy.
Nellie was recovering, but very slowly, and she
also remained invisible. Arthur Angell manifested
all the symptoms of resentment and disappointed
love, and only Philip Hume's usual
placid cheerfulness redeemed the house from an
atmosphere of intolerable depression. Philip
had discovered a fund of amusement in the
study of Mrs. Hodge. As soon as that good
lady's first apprehensions were soothed, she was
seized with an immense and exuberant pride in
her daughter, which found expression both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
her words and her bearing. Though ignorant
of the historical precedent, she assumed the
demeanor of a mother of the Gracchi, and
pointed out to all who would listen to her&mdash;and
Philip never thought of refusing her this kindness&mdash;small
incidents and traits of character
which had marked out Nellie from her very
cradle as one of heroic mold and dauntless
courage.</p>

<p>"I should be astonished, if I did not know
her mother," said Philip politely.</p>

<p>"Ah, you must be chaffing, of course. But
it's not me she takes it from. My heart goes
pit-a-pat at a mouse."</p>

<p>"Oh, then it's Mr. Hodge."</p>

<p>"You couldn't," said Mrs. Hodge with emphasis,
"catch Hodge at a loss. He was ready
for anything. He'd have been proud to see
Nellie to-day. Look what the papers are
saying of her!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure she deserves it all."</p>

<p>"Aye, that she does: she deserves all Dale
Bannister can do for her."</p>

<p>Philip scented danger in this topic, and
changed the subject.</p>

<p>"When are we to see her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In a day or two, I expect. She's much better
this morning. She's asked to see the papers,
and I'm going to take her the <i>Chronicle</i>."</p>

<p>"How delightful to read of one's heroic actions!
I have never enjoyed the sensation."</p>

<p>"Nor ever will, young man, if you spend
all your time loafing," said Mrs. Hodge incisively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there must be some ordinary people,"
protested Philip. "The <i>rôle</i> is unappreciated,
so it's the more creditable in me to stick to it."</p>

<p>"A parcel of nonsense! Where's that
paper?"</p>

<p>She took it, went upstairs, and gave it to
Nellie.</p>

<p>"There, read that. See what they say about
you, my dearie. I'm going to see little Roberts,
and I shall be back in an hour. You've got
the bell by you, and the nurse'll hear you."</p>

<p>Nellie, left alone, began to read the <i>Chronicle</i>.
She read the whole account from beginning to
end, the article in praise of her, and, in the
later edition, the editor's romantic forecast.
Then she put the papers aside, exclaiming:
"Oh, if it could be true!" and lay back with
closed eyes.</p>

<p>A few days later she made her first appearance
in the drawing room, where she held a
little court. Her mother hung over all, anticipating
far more wants than the patient was
likely to feel, and by constant anxious questions
almost producing the fatigue she wished to
guard against. Tora Smith was there, in a state
of gleeful adoration; and Arthur Angell, his
sorrows temporarily laid aside, ready with a
mock heroic ode; and Philip Hume, new come
from Mrs. Roberts' with good news and a high
eulogy on Dr. Spink's most marked and assiduous
attention.</p>

<p>"I really believe," he said, with a laugh,
"that Mrs. Roberts will have another chance of
being a Denborough doctor's wife, if she likes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would be an ideal ending," said Tora.</p>

<p>"Therefore it will not happen," Arthur remarked.</p>

<p>"Poets are allowed to be pessimistic," rejoined
Tora. "But you're wrong, Mr. Angell.
Ideal things do happen."</p>

<p>"To Sir Harry Fulmer, for instance," put in
Philip.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mr. Hume! I wasn't thinking
of that. Don't you agree with me, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"Nellie has made an ideal thing happen,"
said Philip, and Nellie blushed.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Phil," said Dale. "It's complimentary
to describe the prolongation of my
poor existence in that way."</p>

<p>"The deed is good, however unworthy the
object, Dale."</p>

<p>Dale took Nellie's hand and patted it gently.</p>

<p>"Good child," he said, and Nellie flushed
again with an almost strange intensity of embarrassment.
Tora rose abruptly, and, in spite
of opposition, insisted on departure. Dale
escorted her to her carriage.</p>

<p>"I have asked Nellie to come and stay with
me," said she, "as soon as she is well enough
to move."</p>

<p>"She will like that. I hope she is going?"</p>

<p>"She said," Tora went on, speaking with
emphasis, "that she would ask you."</p>

<p>Dale made a little gesture of protest, partly
against Nellie's reported saying, more against
the reporter's inquiring gaze. He began to be
astonished at the interest he was so unfortunate
as to inspire in his affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall advise her to go," he said. "I think
a change will be good for her."</p>

<p>"I incline to think so too," said Tora with
sudden coldness; "but I thought you might not
like to part with her."</p>

<p>"Mount Pleasant is not inaccessible," responded
Dale with equal coldness. Returning
to the house, he found Nellie gone, the company
dispersed, and Mrs. Hodge in his smoking
room, apparently expecting him.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," he said,&mdash;he had used to
call her "mother" when he was always running
in and out of her house in London,&mdash;"Nellie
looks quite blooming."</p>

<p>"She's mending nicely."</p>

<p>"I hear she's to go to the Smiths'."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought of taking her to Brighton."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be more amusing at the Smiths';
unless, of course, she needs the sea."</p>

<p>"She thought, or I thought rather, that you
might like to come with us for a while?" said
Mrs. Hodge in a tentative tone.</p>

<p>"I can't get away," answered Dale decisively.
Nothing would have taken him away from the
Grange gates.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodge took her courage in both hands.</p>

<p>"Look here, Dale," she said. "You know
I'm not one of those women that lay hold of a
man if he as much as looks at a girl, and asks
him what he means by it. That's not my way.
Hodge used to say girls could take care of
themselves mostly&mdash;p'r'aps he wasn't far out.
But Nellie's not that sort, and her father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
gone, good man, and&mdash;&mdash;" and the excellent
lady came to a full stop.</p>

<p>Dale loved this honest old woman for long
acquaintance' sake and much kindness. He
laid his hand on her shoulder and said:</p>

<p>"It's a sad world, mother."</p>

<p>"The child's fond of you, Dale. She's shown
that."</p>

<p>"I'm a crossed lover too, mother. We can
only weep together."</p>

<p>"What, you mean that Grange girl?" asked
Mrs. Hodge, her love for her own making her
tone tart.</p>

<p>"Yes, that Grange girl," answered Dale, with
a rueful smile. "And just at present that
Grange girl won't have anything to say to
me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodge pressed his hand and whispered:</p>

<p>"Don't you tell Nellie what I say, but let her
go, dearie, and take my girl. She's sick for
you, Dale, though she'd kill me if she heard me
say it."</p>

<p>"Aye, but I'm sick for the Grange girl,
mother."</p>

<p>"You don't take it ill of me, Dale? But
there! a kind word from you is more than the
doctors to her. She'd say nothing of what
she's done, and I say nothing, but she's a good
girl, and a pretty girl."</p>

<p>"That she is, and she deserves a better man
than I am."</p>

<p>"Well, there it is! Talking mends no holes,"
said Mrs. Hodge, with a heavy sigh. Then she
added, in an outburst of impatience:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you ever come to this miserable
little place?"</p>

<p>Dale raised inquiring hands to heaven and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"What they call fate, mother," said he.
"Come, cheer up. She'll get over this little
idea. She'll be all right."</p>

<p>"Please God," said Mrs. Hodge. "It's time
for her beef-tea."</p>

<p>The phrase Please God is as a rule expressive
of the speaker's desire, but not of his expectation.
So it was with Mrs. Hodge, but
Dale could not bring himself to take so gloomy
a view. A man's own passion assumes a most
imposing appearance of permanence, but he
finds it easy to look with incredulity on a like
assumption in the feelings of others. He had
keen sympathy for Nellie in the moment or the
period of pain which seemed to lie before her,
but experience told him that all probabilities
were in favor of her escaping from it at no distant
time. Love like his for Janet&mdash;and, till
this unhappy day, he would have added, Janet's
for him&mdash;was exceptional; change, recovery,
oblivion&mdash;these were the rule, the happy rule
whose operation smoothed love's rough ways.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, be this wide philosophical view
as just as it might, the present position came
nigh to being intolerable, and it was hard to
blame him if he looked forward to Nellie's departure
with relief. Her presence accused him
of cruelty, for it seems cruel to refuse what
would give happiness, and it increased every
day it continued the misunderstanding which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
already existed as to their future relations.
Even now, in spite of Janet's protest, Dale was
convinced he had detected an undercurrent of
jealousy, flowing in to re-enforce the stream of
that higher, but stranger and wilder, feeling
which had made her drive him away. If she
heard that Nellie remained at his house, and
what conclusion was universally drawn from
the fact, he was afraid that, when restored
health carried away the morbid idea which was
now most prominent, the jealousy might remain,
and, if it did, Janet's proud nature was ground
on which it would bear fruit bitter for him to
taste.</p>

<p>He could not and did not for a moment
blame Mrs. Hodge for her action. It was the
natural outcome of her love, and she had performed
her difficult task, as it seemed to him,
with a perfect observance of all the essential
marks of good breeding, however homely her
method had been. But she could not understand
even his love for Janet, much less another
feeling in him, which aided to make her intercession
vain. For he did not deny now that,
besides the joy he had in Janet as a woman
merely, there was also the satisfaction he derived
from the fact that she was Miss Delane
of Dirkham Grange. Fools and would-be cynics
might dismiss this as snobbery; but Dale told
himself that he was right and wise in clinging
to the place in this new world which his sojourn
at Denborough had opened to him, and which
a marriage with Janet would secure for him in
perpetuity. Setting aside altogether questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of sentiment, he felt it useless not to recognize
that, if he married Nellie Fane, he would drift
back into his old world, the gates would close
again, and the fresh realms of life and experience,
which had delighted his taste and stimulated
his genius, would be his to wander in no
more. He had grown to love this world, this
old world so new to him; and he loved Janet
not least because all about her, her face, her
speech, her motions, her every air, were redolent
to him of its assured distinction and unboastful
pride. Nay, even these fantastic scruples of
hers were but a distortion of a noble instinct
born in her blood, and witnessed to a nature
and qualities that he could look for only in the
shade of some such place as Dirkham Grange.
He felt as if he too belonged to her race, and
had been all his life an exile from his native
land, whither at last a happy chance had led
back his wandering feet. What would dear old
Mother Hodge understand of all that? What
even would Nellie herself, for all her ready
sympathies? It was a feeling that, not vulgar
in itself, seemed to become vulgar in the telling;
and, after all, he had no need of other justification
than his love and his pledged word.</p>

<p>He looked out of the window and saw Arthur
Angell walking moodily up and down. Putting
on his hat, he joined him, passing his arm
through his. Arthur turned to him with a
petulant look.</p>

<p>"A lot of miserables we are, old boy," said
Dale, pressing the arm he held. "I am often
tempted to regret, Arthur, that the state has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
not charged itself with the control of marriages.
It would relieve us all of a large amount of
trouble, and I really don't see that it would
hurt anyone except novelists. I am feeling
badly in need of a benevolent despotism."</p>

<p>"I'm going back to town," Arthur announced
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry. But I don't know that it's
any use asking you to stay. Nellie goes to the
Smiths' in a day or two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It makes no difference to me where she
goes," interrupted the unhappy young man.
"I&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean."</p>

<p>Philip came up, and glanced keenly at
Arthur. Then he smiled good-humoredly and
said:</p>

<p>"Shall I prophesy unto you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Arthur. "I know you're going
to say it'll be all the same six months hence."</p>

<p>"I was. I can't deny it, Arthur. You forget
that I have seen you like this many times
before. We may have a tragedy or we may
not, Arthur, but I shall take leave to eliminate
you from the cast."</p>

<p>"I'm going to pack," said Arthur angrily, and
he went into the house.</p>

<p>"When there are real troubles about," said
Philip, "it is well to clear the ground. There's
not much the matter with him."</p>

<p>"I think he feels it rather, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it's worth a set of verses."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it's no worse; for, to tell
you the truth, Phil, there's enough to worry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
about without Arthur. I'm glad our party is
breaking up."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We know too much about one another to
live together comfortably."</p>

<p>"True. Shall I go?"</p>

<p>"No," said Dale, with a smile; "you may
stay and keep watch over the razors."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>The Scene of the Outrage.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">The excitement and bustle which attended
and followed on the attempted
murder, the suicide, the inquest, the
illnesses, and the true and false reports
concerning each and all of these incidents, had
hardly subsided before the Mayor of Market
Denborough, with the perseverance that distinguished
him, began once more to give his
attention to the royal visit. For reasons which
will be apparent to all who study the manner
in which one man becomes a knight while
another remains unhonored, the Mayor was
particularly anxious that the Institute should
not lose the <i>éclat</i> which the Duke of Mercia had
promised to bestow on its opening, and that its
opening should take place during his mayoralty.</p>

<p>The finger of fame pointed at Mr. Maggs
the horse-dealer as Mr. Hedger's successor, and
the idea of the waters of the fountain of honor
flowing on to the head of Maggs, instead of on
to his own, spurred the Mayor to keen exertion.
He had interviews with the Squire, he wrote to
the Lord Lieutenant, he promoted a petition
from the burgesses, and he carried a resolution
in the Town Council. Mr. Delane was prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
upon to use his influence with the Lord
Lieutenant; the Lord Lieutenant could not, in
view of Mr. Delane's urgent appeal, refuse to
lay the question before his Royal Highness;
and his Royal Highness was graciously pleased
to say that he could not deny himself the pleasure
of obliging Lord Cransford, knowing not
that he was in fact and in truth, if it may be
spoken without <i>lèse-majesté</i>, merely an instrument
in the clever fingers of a gentleman who,
when the Prince was writing his reply, was rolling
pills in the parlor behind his shop in the
town of Market Denborough.</p>

<p>Now, Colonel Smith had never concealed his
opinion that, however much evil that unhappy
man James Roberts had to answer for, yet he
deserved a scrap of grateful memory, inasmuch
as he had by his action averted the calamity
that was threatening the town, and, furthermore,
robbed Dale Bannister of the chance of
prostituting his genius. Accordingly, when it
was announced in the <i>Standard</i>, three or four
weeks after James Roberts had shot at Dale
Bannister and wounded Nellie Fane, that the
Duke had given a conditional promise to pay
his deferred visit in June, the Colonel laid down
the paper and said to the rest of the breakfast
party at Mount Pleasant&mdash;and the Colonel must
bear the responsibility for the terms he thought
proper to employ:</p>

<p>"That old fool Cransford has nobbled the
whippersnapper again! We're to have him
after all! Good Lord!"</p>

<p>Tora at once appreciated his meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa means the Prince is coming, Nellie!"
cried she. "How splendid!"</p>

<p>"Bannister will have a chance of blacking
his boots now," pursued the Colonel, trying to
impose a malignant sneer on his obstinately
kindly countenance.</p>

<p>"You are not to say such things," said Nellie
emphatically. "You know you don't mean
them."</p>

<p>"Not mean them?" exclaimed the Colonel.</p>

<p>"No. You're not horrid, and it's no use trying
to make yourself horrid. Is it, Tora?"</p>

<p>Tora's thoughts were far away.</p>

<p>"In June," she said meditatively. "I hope it
won't be the first week, or we shall have to
come back early."</p>

<p>The Colonel's face expressed concentrated
scorn.</p>

<p>"You would cut short your honeymoon in
order to come back?"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear. I wouldn't miss it. Oh,
and, Nellie, I shall go in next after Lady Cransford!"</p>

<p>This was too much for the Colonel; he said
nothing himself, but his joy was great when Sir
Harry pointed out that Mrs. Hedger would have
official precedence over the new Lady Fulmer.
The Colonel chuckled, and Tora pretended that
she had remembered about Mrs. Hedger all the
time.</p>

<p>"Johnstone will probably take you in, Tora,"
said Sir Harry, who had lately found himself
able to treat Tora with less fearful
respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care. I shall talk to the Prince.
Now, Nellie, you must come down for it."</p>

<p>Nellie would not give any promise, and Tora
forbore to press her, for she confessed to herself
and to Sir Harry that she did not quite understand
the position of affairs. Janet Delane
remained in strict seclusion; doctor's orders
were alleged, but Tora was inclined to be
skeptical, for she had seen Janet out driving,
and reported that she looked strong and well.
Dale was at Littlehill, and he was there alone,
Philip having gone back to London with Arthur
Angell. He often came over to Mount Pleasant,
to see Nellie, no doubt; and when he came, he
was most attentive and kind to her. Yet he
resolutely refused to stay in the house, always
returning in an hour or two to his solitary life
at Littlehill. He seemed never to see Janet,
and to know not much more about her than
the rest of the world did. He never referred to
her unquestioned, and when he spoke of Nellie's
share in the scene in the garden, he appeared
pointedly to avoid discussing Janet's. Tora
concluded that there was some break in his
relations with Janet, and, led on by her sympathies,
had small difficulty in persuading herself
that he was by degrees being induced by
affection and gratitude to feel toward Nellie as
everybody expected and wished him to feel.
Only, if so, it was hard to see why Nellie's
pleasure in his visits seemed mingled with a
nervousness which the increased brightness of
her prospects did not allay. Evidently she also
was puzzled by Janet's conduct; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
equally clear that she did not yet feel confident
that Dale had renounced his fancy for Janet and
given his heart to her.</p>

<p>In after-days Dale was wont to declare that
the fortnight he passed alone at Littlehill was
the most miserable in his life, and people given
to improving the occasion would then tell him
that he had no experience of what real misery
was. Yet he was very miserable. He was sore
to the heart at Janet's treatment of him; she
would neither see him, nor, till he absolutely
insisted, write to him, and then she sent three
words: "It's no use." In face of this incredible
delusion of hers he felt himself helpless;
and the Squire, with all the good will in the
world to him, could only shrug his shoulders
and say that Jan was a strange girl; while
Mrs. Delane, knowing nothing of the cause of
her daughter's refusal to see Dale, had once
again begun to revive her old hopes, and allowed
herself to hint at them to her favorite Gerard
Ripley. Of course this latter fact was not
known to Dale, but he was aware that Captain
Ripley had called two or three times at the
Grange, and had seen Janet once. The "doctor's
orders" applied, it seemed, to him alone;
and his bitterness of heart increased, mingling
with growing impatience and resentment.
Nellie could never have acted like this: she
was too kind and gentle; love was real in her, a
mastering power, and not itself the plaything of
fantastic scruples&mdash;unless a worse thing were
true, unless the scruples themselves were the
screen of some unlooked-for and sudden infidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of heart. The thought was treason, but
he could not stifle it. Yet, even while it possessed
him, while he told himself that he had
now full right to transfer his allegiance, that no
one could blame him, that every motive urged
him, all the while in his inmost mind he never
lost the knowledge that it was Janet he wanted;
and when he came to see Nellie, he was unable,
even if he had been willing&mdash;and he told himself
he was&mdash;to say anything but words of
friendship and thanks, unable to frame a sentence
distantly approaching the phrases of love
he knew she longed to hear.</p>

<p>Matters were in this very unsatisfactory condition
when Philip Hume returned to Littlehill,
and straightway became the unwilling recipient
of Dale's troubled confidences. A fortnight's
solitude had been too much for Dale, and he
poured out his perplexities, saying, with an
apologetic laugh:</p>

<p>"I'm bound to tell someone. I believe, if
you hadn't come, I should have made a clean
breast of it to the Mayor."</p>

<p>"You might do worse. The Mayor is a man
of sagacity. This young woman seems very
unreasonable."</p>

<p>"What young woman?"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Delane."</p>

<p>"Well, Phil, you must allow for the delicacy
of her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You called it infernal nonsense yourself just
now."</p>

<p>"I wish, Phil, you'd call at the Grange and
see her, and tell me what you think about her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't do any good, but I'll go, if you
like."</p>

<p>Accordingly he went, and did, as he expected,
no good at all. Janet had resumed her
ordinary manner, with an additional touch or
two of vivacity and loquaciousness, which betrayed
the uneasiness they were meant to hide.
The only subjects she discussed were the last
new novel and Tora Smith's wedding, and
Philip took his leave, entirely unenlightened.
The Squire offered to walk part of the way with
him and they set out together.</p>

<p>The Squire stopped at the scene of the disaster.
Pointing with his toe to a spot by the
side of the drive:</p>

<p>"That's where that mad wretch stood, holding
my poor girl," he said.</p>

<p>Philip nodded.</p>

<p>"And where was Dale?" he asked, for it was
his first visit to the spot.</p>

<p>The Squire was delighted to be <i>cicerone</i>.</p>

<p>"He was standing with his back to that tree
yonder, about fifteen yards off, looking due
north, toward the house, thinking of a poem or
some nonsense, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"Well, then," pursued the Squire, "you see
he was almost in a straight line with Roberts&mdash;Roberts'
barrel must have pointed straight
toward Denborough church spire. After the
first shot Bannister sprang forward&mdash;the gravel
was soft, and we saw every footprint&mdash;to where
Miss Fane fell, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where did she fall?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The Squire's toe indicated a spot about three
yards from the tree.</p>

<p>"She was running up from behind Bannister,
you know, and had just got across the line of
fire when the bullet caught her. She fell forward
on her face,&mdash;she was bound to, Spink
said, from the way she was hit,&mdash;and Bannister
just got his arm under her, to break her fall."</p>

<p>"She was running toward him, I suppose, to
warn him?"</p>

<p>"To get between him and Roberts, like the
noble girl she is, no doubt; but she seemed to
have turned round on hearing the shot, because,
to judge from the way she was lying,
she was, at the moment she fell, heading almost
south."</p>

<p>"What, toward the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a slanting line, from the tree toward
the house."</p>

<p>"That's away from Bannister?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and from Roberts too. You see, she
must have turned. It was a fine thing. Well,
I must get back; I'm busy with all the preparations
for this affair. Good-day, Mr. Hume.
Very kind of you to come and see us."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to find Miss Delane better."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's better, thanks, but not herself
yet, by any means. Good-day."</p>

<p>Philip went home, lit a pipe, and drew a neat
little plan of the scene which had just been so
carefully described to him. By the time the
drawing was made the pipe was finished, and
he was obliged to light another, which he consumed
while he sat gazing at his handiwork.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
He was still pondering over it when Dale came
in, and flung himself into an armchair with a
restless sigh.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" asked Philip.</p>

<p>"Only that I'm the most miserable dog alive.
I tell you what, Phil, I'm going to settle this
affair one way or the other. I won't be played
with any more. I shall go up to the Grange
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You can't&mdash;it's Fulmer's wedding."</p>

<p>"Hang his wedding! Well, then, next day&mdash;and
get a definite answer from Janet. It's too
bad of her. Did you have any talk with her
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Only general conversation. She gave me
no chance."</p>

<p>"I don't understand her, but I'll have it
settled. I've been at Mount Pleasant, and&mdash;by
God, Phil, I can't stand the sort of anxious,
beseeching way Nellie looks. I know it sounds
absurd to hear a man talk like that, but it's a
fact."</p>

<p>"Then why do you go?"</p>

<p>"Well, considering what she's done, I don't
see how I can very well stay away."</p>

<p>"Oh! No, I suppose not," said Philip,
touching up his plan; "but if I were you,
Dale, I should wait a bit before I bothered
Miss Delane again. Give her time, man."</p>

<p>"No, I won't. She's not treating me fairly."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it? You want
to marry her, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Then give her time. Give her a week at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
events. You can sound her at the wedding
to-morrow, but don't present your ultimatum."</p>

<p>And Dale agreed, on much persuasion, to
give her a week.</p>

<p>"That's more sensible. And, Dale, may I
ask Arthur Angell down for a day or two?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but I don't know whether he'll
come."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll come, fast enough."</p>

<p>"What do you want him for?"</p>

<p>"To consult him about a little work of mine,"
answered Philip, regarding his sketch critically.</p>

<p>"Going to publish something?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. That depends."</p>

<p>"On the publishers? <i>Ça va sans dire.</i> But
how can Arthur help you?"</p>

<p>"He was there."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Now, Dale, I can understand your impatience&mdash;but
you must wait. If I publish it, you
shall see it."</p>

<p>"Is it my sort? Shall I like it?"</p>

<p>"I think your feelings would be mixed," said
Philip, delicately filling in Nellie Fane's figure
on the ground.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>Against her Better Judgment.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">It is never well to vie with experts in
their own subjects; humiliation surely
attends the audacious attempt, and a
humiliation which receives and deserves
no softening sympathy. Moreover, even
if the technical difficulties could be overcome,
the description of a wedding must be either
florid or cynical, assuming impossible happiness,
or insinuating improbable catastrophe. Wherefore
this narrative, which abhors either of these
extremes, takes leave to resume its course at
the moment when Sir Harry and Lady Fulmer
have been driven away for their honeymoon,
and the guests at Mount Pleasant are engaged
in looking at one another's presents, one
another's clothes, and their own watches,
while a group of men have sought retirement
and cigars in the garden. The Lord Lieutenant
was paying compliments of alarming elaboration
and stateliness to Nellie Fane; and Janet
Delane, having discharged her duty in that line
with generous graciousness, was looking with
despair at Captain Ripley's puzzled face and betugged
mustache, and wondering why men
could not or would not understand plain English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
and why&mdash;why above all&mdash;they had no
more sense of dignity or of timeliness than to
renew useless entreaties in a roomful of people,
and&mdash;to descend to the particular case&mdash;with
Dale Bannister only a few yards away, paying
obvious inattention to a rhapsodic bridesmaid.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a pretty wedding?" asked the
bridesmaid. "You know I'm a stranger to
Denborough, and I never knew you had so
many beautiful girls. It might have been St.
Peter's."</p>

<p>"Might it?" said Dale, with an absent
smile, entirely unappreciative of the compliment.
He did not know what or where St.
Peter's was.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was lovely. Well, dear Tora herself
is very pretty. And then, Miss Delane! I do
<i>love</i> that severe, statuesque style, don't you?
How pale she is, though! she doesn't look very
happy, does she? Oh, and Miss Fane! Isn't
she lovely? She sings, doesn't she? I think
people of that kind are so nice. Oh, and I've
heard all about her. How nice it was of her to
be so brave, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Naturally, I think so."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I forgot. It's so nice when
people are good and pretty too, isn't it? After
all, good looks do go for something, don't
they?" and she fixed a pair of large and unnaturally
innocent eyes on Dale.</p>

<p>"You must tell me about that," he said with
labored politeness. "How do you find it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Mr. Bannister! But, seriously,
did you ever see anything so lovely as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the way Sir Harry looked at Tora when they
were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dale had gone&mdash;without a word of excuse.
He had seen Janet rise abruptly, with an impatient
wave of her hand, and Captain Ripley
turn on his heel and disappear into the eddying
throng that was circling round the wedding
presents. He darted across to Janet, and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>"I must see you here," he said, "since you
will not see me at the Grange."</p>

<p>The bridesmaid marked their greeting. She
rose with offended dignity and returned to her
mother. She says to this day that she has only
known one poet, and he was not at all nice, and
concludes, after the manner of a certain part of
humanity, that none of the rest are nice either.</p>

<p>Janet looked at Dale doubtfully, then she led
the way to a little room which was free from
the crowd. Then she sat down. "I'm very
tired," she said, "and I want to stay here and
rest. Will you let me?"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean, Jan. How can I,
when I never have a chance of saying what I
want to say to you? You talk to Ripley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't comfort Gerard Ripley much."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," said Dale heartlessly.</p>

<p>"I'm not much troubled about him. I'm
only a habit to him."</p>

<p>"I don't care twopence about him. Jan, when
is this sort of thing to end? Don't you like
seeing me?"</p>

<p>Janet had made up her mind to treat Dale at
first with simple friendliness; if this recipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
failed, it was to be followed by distant civility.
She answered collectedly enough, in spite of a
quiver in her voice:</p>

<p>"I thought I had better not see you just
now."</p>

<p>"Why, in Heaven's name?"</p>

<p>"I can't go through it all again. Indeed I
can't, Dale."</p>

<p>"Do you seriously expect me to be content
with what you said then&mdash;to go away and never
come near you again?"</p>

<p>Dale spoke vehemently. It was obvious that
the distant civility would be called into play.
Perhaps silence was Janet's idea of it, for she
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Because that's what it comes to," pursued
Dale. "Do you imagine, Jan, I could see you
now&mdash;after it all&mdash;except as your lover? What
do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Miss Fane&mdash;&mdash;" began Janet in a very small
voice.</p>

<p>"I'll never see Nellie Fane again if she robs
me of you," Dale declared with great energy,
and probably perfect, though unintentional,
untruth.</p>

<p>Janet looked up and met his eyes. Then she
dropped hers, and said, in tones quite unlike
those of distant civility:</p>

<p>"I wonder how you care for such a mean-spirited
creature as I am. If I told you I loved
you still&mdash;how could you believe me? I told
you before, and then I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Behaved like a sensible girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no. It was a lie when I said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me another, then," said Dale. "I like
them."</p>

<p>Janet's resistance, like Bob Acres' courage,
was oozing out of her finger tips.</p>

<p>"I know what it will be," she faltered plaintively.
"You'll always be thinking about her,
and so shall I&mdash;and it will be horrible. No, I
won't do it. I have some resolution, Dale; it
wasn't mere nonsense. I did mean it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Dale persuasively; "you
never did, Jan. You had no idea how bored
you would be without me. Now, had you?"</p>

<p>"I can never respect myself again."</p>

<p>"It's quite unnecessary, dear; I'll do all
that."</p>

<p>"Are you really quite&mdash;quite sure, Dale, that
you will never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it all!" said Dale, and he kissed
her.</p>

<p>"Dale! the door's open."</p>

<p>Dale shut it, and the rest of the conversation
became inaudible, and remains unknown.</p>

<p>The guests had gone. Mrs. Hodge and
Nellie, who were to keep the Colonel company
for a little while, had walked down to Denborough
to tell Mrs. Roberts all about the event
of the day; and the Colonel was bustling about,
getting the presents packed up, and counting,
with some surprise, the empty champagne
bottles. He was thus engaged when the door
of the little room opened, to let Janet and Dale
out.</p>

<p>"Dear me! I thought you'd gone. Nellie
asked me, and I told her so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am just going, Colonel Smith," said Janet.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Dale.</p>

<p>The Colonel watched them go together.</p>

<p>"There's another man going to lose his
daughter," he said. "By Jove, I thought it was
to be Nellie Fane!"</p>

<p>When Janet left Dale at the Grange gates,
she went to her father's study.</p>

<p>"Lord, child," said the Squire, "are you only
just back?"</p>

<p>"I stayed to see them off."</p>

<p>"Your mother did that, and she's been back
two hours. She couldn't find you."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Janet, sitting on the arm of his
chair, "I'm very much ashamed of myself."</p>

<p>"What have you been, doing now? Ill treating
that poor young man again?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He's not a bad fellow, you know, after all&mdash;honest
and good&mdash;not brilliant, of course."</p>

<p>"Not brilliant, papa?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean he's a fool; I believe he's an
efficient officer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Officer? Why, you're talking of Gerard!"</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>"How can you imagine I was thinking of
Gerard? I meant Mr. Bannister."</p>

<p>"Bannister? Why, you told me only the
other day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's why."</p>

<p>"Why what, child?"</p>

<p>"Why I'm ashamed."</p>

<p>The Squire raised himself and looked severely
at his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"A precious fuss you've made about nothing."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, papa. I don't want to, but
he insists."</p>

<p>"He seems to know how to manage you,
which is more than I do. There, go and tell
your mother. And, Jan!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If ever you say you won't have him
again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa."</p>

<p>"By Jove, you shan't!" said the Squire with
emphasis, and he added, as his daughter fled
after a hasty kiss, "Perhaps that'll keep her
quiet."</p>

<p>Dale found nobody but Philip Hume to congratulate
him, and Philip was, as usual now,
busy over his little plan.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's come round, has she?" he asked,
with no sign of surprise.</p>

<p>Dale said she had, and Philip meditatively
took up his little plan.</p>

<p>"Have you told Nellie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. I haven't seen her."</p>

<p>"She never knew you had asked Miss Delane
before?"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody knew but her people and you.
I think she had an idea I liked Jan."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not more?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't think so."</p>

<p>Philip whistled gently, and twisted the little
plan in his fingers. Dale, in his good humor,
said:</p>

<p>"Why the deuce, Phil, do you go on fidgeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
with that thing? You're like an old hen over
an egg."</p>

<p>"Yes; I don't know that it is any good. I
think I'll destroy it."</p>

<p>And he tore it slowly in two, and threw it in
the fire.</p>

<p>"The vindictive theory of punishment," he
remarked, with apparent irrelevance, "does not
commend itself to me. If no evil consequences
exist to be averted, why should we punish?"
and he pushed the plan farther into the blaze
with the poker.</p>

<p>"If you want to argue that sort of thing, old
fellow, you must ring for Wilson. I'm going to
have a try at some verses."</p>

<p>"Going to write your own epitaph, like
Swift?"</p>

<p>Dale shook his head and smiled, with the
impenetrable, hopeless happiness of successful
love.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Villain Unmasked.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">A few days after Dale's love affairs
had begun to flow in a more peaceful
channel the Mayor of Market Denborough
had an interview with Mr.
Philip Hume, and Philip emerged from the conversation
with a smile of mingled amusement
and perplexity on his face. The Mayor had
been to the Grange; the Squire fully approved
of the scheme; a hundred pounds was subscribed
already, and another twenty or thirty
expected. Philip was requested to act as an
intermediary, and find out from Miss Fane
what form she would prefer that the testimonial
which Denborough intended to offer
to her, in recognition of her signal gallantry,
should take.</p>

<p>"I wanted to wait and make it a wedding
present," said the Mayor, with a wink, "but
the Squire thinks we had better not wait for
that."</p>

<p>"Ah, does he?" said Philip.</p>

<p>"Though what Mr. Bannister's waitin' for
I can't see; and I said as much to Miss Janet
when I met her in the garden."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did she say?" asked Philip in some
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, now you ask me, I don't think she
said anything. She seemed a bit put-out like
about something."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been anything you
said?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir. I only said as I shouldn't be
slow to move if a young lady like Miss Fane
was waitin' for me&mdash;and her havin' saved my
life, too."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!"</p>

<p>"Beggin' your pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Mr. Mayor, nothing."</p>

<p>"You'll see Miss Fane about it? She hasn't
left the Colonel's."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so. Yes, I'll see her."</p>

<p>Dale had gone to London, alleging that he
had shopping to do, and hardly denying that
his business would lie chiefly at the jeweler's.
Philip was glad that he was away, for he thus
could start on his mission unquestioned. He
found Nellie at home, and at once plunged into
the matter. Directly Nellie understood what
was proposed, she jumped up, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, they mustn't. You must stop
them."</p>

<p>"Why, it's a very natural tribute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't have it! I can't have it! You
must tell them, Mr. Hume."</p>

<p>"It'll look rather ungracious, won't it? Why
shouldn't you take their present?" he asked,
looking at her in a half-amused way.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! You don't understand. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
what a wretched girl I am!" and Nellie, flinging
herself in a chair, began to cry.</p>

<p>He sat and watched her with a grim smile,
which he made an effort to maintain. But the
sobs were rather piteous, and the smile gradually
became very mildly ferocious, and presently
vanished altogether. Presently, also, Nellie
stopped crying, sat up, and stared in front of
her with a dazed look and parted lips.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Philip.</p>

<p>"I won't receive the testimonial."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to say?" he asked in a
tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, plucking nervously at
her handkerchief, "that's all."</p>

<p>"No reason to give?"</p>

<p>"Tell them that there's nothing to give me a
testimonial for."</p>

<p>"Shall I?" he asked.</p>

<p>Nellie glanced at him with a start, but in an
instant she recovered herself.</p>

<p>"I mean that I would much rather no more
fuss was made about what I did."</p>

<p>"As you please," he said coldly. "I will tell
the Mayor, and get him to stop the thing."</p>

<p>"Is Dale at home?" she asked, as Philip
rose.</p>

<p>"He's gone to town. Do you want to see
him about anything?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing in particular&mdash;only&mdash;I haven't
seen him for three or four days."</p>

<p>"Are you staying here long?"</p>

<p>"I am staying till Tora comes home, and
then I go to her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, good-by. I'll tell the Mayor."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much. Good-by."</p>

<p>She was quite calm again by now; her sudden
fit of agitation was over, and apparently she felt
nothing more than a distaste for the parade of
a public presentation. So easy and natural had
her bearing become that Philip Hume, as he
walked away, wondered if he had been on a
wrong scent after all. If so, he had behaved in
a very brutal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He broke off his thoughts abruptly, to recognize
and bow to Janet Delane, who whirled by
in her victoria, on the way to Mount Pleasant.
She seemed to be going to pay a visit to Nellie
Fane. Philip, who liked to hear how things
happen, regretted that he had cut his own visit
short and missed Janet's entry.</p>

<p>Janet whirled on. Her balance of mind,
delicately poised between her love and her
pride, had suffered a new and severe shock
from the Mayor's jocose remarks. She could
not rest. She felt that she must see for herself&mdash;must
see Nellie and find out why everybody
thought what they did&mdash;yes, and what Nellie
thought. She was full of things which she had
to say to Nellie; she was prepared, if need be,
again to sacrifice herself for Nellie, but the truth
about it all at least she was determined to hear;
on what it was, Dale's uncertain happiness again
hung suspended. With her usual frankness and
candor, she straightway began to tell Nellie all
her story. Nellie listened in almost stony stillness.</p>

<p>"It's so hard to speak of," said Janet, "but yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
I think we must. It is wretched to let things go
on like this. At least I am wretched, and I
fear he is, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I am," said Nellie, with a forlorn
laugh.</p>

<p>Janet came and knelt by her and took her
hands.</p>

<p>"You too? you whom we all admire so?
Oh, what a world it is! Why did I ever love
him?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you do love him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And why did I ever make him love
me? Ah, Nellie, if only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie had sprung up.</p>

<p>"How do you know he loves you?" she cried.</p>

<p>"How do I know, dear? Why, he told me."</p>

<p>"When? when?"</p>

<p>"Why, before&mdash;the day before it all happened.
But since then I have felt, and I told him, that
he belonged to you&mdash;I mean, dear, that it must
be you now whom he must really love, and
that I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nellie was not listening.</p>

<p>"He told you before?" she asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, the day before. But afterward&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were actually engaged then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we were."</p>

<p>"I never knew it. I didn't know that. Oh,
how wicked I have been!"</p>

<p>"Wicked? What do you mean?" asked
Janet, puzzled at her companion's strange behavior.</p>

<p>Nellie stood silent, and Janet went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I feel, I can't help feeling, that it is to
you he owes his life&mdash;to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" cried Nellie. "Are you engaged
now?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"Does he still love you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me? Why did you
keep me in the dark? Why did you tempt
me?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I didn't know he had told you. I only
thought he had a fancy&mdash;&mdash; Oh, and I loved
him too! I did indeed!"</p>

<p>"I know, dear," said Janet; "and so, when
you had been so brave, and I so cowardly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Nellie again, and as she spoke
the door opened and Dale Bannister came in.
He was fresh back from London, and had ridden
over to see Nellie.</p>

<p>He stood and looked in surprise from one to
the other. There was evidently something
more than an afternoon call going on.</p>

<p>Nellie greeted his coming almost gladly.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are here? Then I can tell you.
I can't bear it any longer. O Dale, I didn't
know you had told her. Indeed I didn't, or I
would never have done it;" and, carried away
by her emotion, she fell on her knees before
him.</p>

<p>"Why, Nellie, what in the world's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"I have been wicked," she went on quickly,
clinging to his hand. "I have deceived you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
I have told you lies. Oh, how wicked I have
been!"</p>

<p>Dale looked inquiringly at Janet, but she
shook her head in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Well, Nellie, let's sit down quietly and hear
the villainy. What is it?"</p>

<p>She refused to let him raise her, and went on,
as she was, on her knees.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it at first. I didn't think of
it, but when I found you all thought it, and&mdash;and
you were pleased, Dale, I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>Dale saw the only chance of arriving at the
truth was not to interrupt. He signed to Janet
to keep silence.</p>

<p>"I came up meaning to warn you. I was
afraid for you. I saw you standing by the tree,
and I was running toward you, and all of a
sudden I saw him, and the pistol, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused and drooped her head. Dale
pressed her hand and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid," she said, "and I turned and
began to run away, and as I was running, it hit
me." And, her confession ended, she sank into
a little woebegone heap on the floor at his feet.</p>

<p>Dale understood now. She had been tempted
by the hope of winning his love through his
gratitude, and had not refused the false glory
they all thrust upon her. Now she had heard
her hopes were vain, that they had been vain
even before that night, and in the misery of sin,
and useless sin, she lay crying at his feet, not
daring to look up at him.</p>

<p>He stood there awkwardly, as a man stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
when he feels more moved than he allows himself
to show.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" he said, with a break in his
voice. "Poor child!"</p>

<p>Janet caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"What does she say? That she didn't save
you?" she whispered eagerly. "That she was
running away?"</p>

<p>Dale nodded, and Janet fell down beside
Nellie, embracing her, and saying, half laughing,
half crying: "O Nellie, how sweet, how
sweet of you to have been a coward too!"</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2 center mid"><b>A Vision.</b></p>

<p class="pn p1">The lawn at Dirkham Grange was a
gay scene. The Institute was opened,
the luncheon consumed, the Royal
Duke gone, full to the last of graciousness,
though the poor fellow was hungry for
solitude and cigars; and now the society of the
county was unbending in friendly condescension
to the society of the town, and talking the
whole thing over under the trees and beside
the bright flower-beds. Lord Cransford,
between Janet and Dale, mingled praises of
the ode with congratulations on the engagement;
no one would have guessed that he
shared a son's disappointment. The Mayor
indifferently dissembled his exultation over the
whisper of a knighthood which a hint from
his Royal Highness had set running through
the company. Mrs. Johnstone sat placidly in
an armchair, the ruby velvet spread in careful
folds, while Sir Harry Fulmer paid her compliments,
and wondered where his wife was,
and how soon they might go; and his wife
walked with the Squire, declaring in her
impetuous way that Nellie Fane's deceit was
the most beautiful and touching thing she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
ever heard of, whereat the Squire tugged his
whisker, and said that nobody was disposed
to be hard on her. Mrs. Roberts had made
her first public appearance, diligently attended
by Dr. Spink, who said, but was disbelieved in
saying, that she still needed constant care.
Nellie Fane herself had been persuaded to
come, on a promise that the Mayor should not
be allowed to reopen the subject of the
testimonial; and Arthur Angell, in whose
breast hope was once more a sojourner, had
led her to a retired walk, and was reading to
her a set of verses, called "Love's Crime";
and Nellie shook her head, saying that there
was no inducement to be good if everyone
conspired to pet and pamper the wicked.</p>

<p>Philip Hume sat alone under a spreading
tree, looking on, and talking to nobody. The
bustle of the morning, and the sumptuous midday
meal worked together with the warm afternoon
air and the distant sounds of the yeomanry
band to make him a little drowsy, and he
watched the people walking to and fro, and
heard their chatter in a half-wakeful, half-sleeping
state. And, strange as it seems in
this workaday, skeptical age, he fell into a
sort of trance, and visions of what should be
were vouchsafed to him, and if the visions
were not true, at least they had a look of truth.</p>

<p>He saw a man, handsome still, for all that
his thick hair was a little thinned by time and
his waistcoat was broadening, and the man
read in a mellow voice lines, which Philip did
not hear very plainly, about the greatness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
England, the glory of the Throne, and the
calmer judgment of circling years tempering the
heat of youth. Then a stately dame touched
him gently on the shoulder, saying that the
verses were magnificent, but the carriage
waited to take him to the <i>levée</i>; and he rose
to go with a smile, not seeming to notice a pale
ghost, that clenched impotent shadowy hands
in wrath and with a scowl shrank away. Suddenly,
across this vision came the form of Mrs.
Hodge, white-haired, but cheerful and buxom
as of yore, and she said: "Well, Hume, she's
made Arthur a happy man at last;" and the
Mayor, who somehow happened to be there,
wearing on his breast a large placard, inscribed
"Sir James Hedger, Knight," added, quite in
his old way: "We were all wrong, Mr. Hume,
sir, except you, sir, beggin' your pardon."
Then the Squire's voice broke in, as though in
the course of an argument, and declared that it
was nonsense to attribute Dale's change of
views to anything except growing wisdom;
and the phantom of Colonel Smith, a copy of
"The Clarion" in his hand, answered: "Bosh!"
And a crowd of quite indistinguishable, well-dressed
shades gathered round the Colonel,
and Philip heard them talking about the inevitable
gravitation of culture and intelligence. But
the Colonel still answered "Bosh!" and Philip
did not hear the end of the matter, nor where
the truth of it lay; for presently all the forms
passed away, and he saw a little room, a little
dingy room, and a gray-haired, slouching fellow
in an old coat, smoking an old pipe and scribbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
on foolscap, scribbling away far into the
night, and then sitting and musing for a solitary
half hour in front of his dying fire before
he went to bed. There was something in this
figure that made Philip curious, and he went
nearer and looked. Hush! It was himself,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He awoke with a start. Dale was smiling
down on him with his old friendly smile, and
saying to Janet Delane:</p>

<p>"We shall never let this old chap leave us
for long, shall we, Jan?"</p>

<p class="pn large p4">QUAKER IDYLS.</p>

<p class="pn1">By Mrs. <span class="smcap">S. M. H. Gardner</span>, 16mo,
buckram, with frontispiece, 75 cents.</p>

<p class="pa1"><i>Twelfth Street Meeting</i> and <i>Uncle Joseph</i> both
treat of the bashful Quaker in love, with a quiet
humor and an effective but unobtrusive description
of Quaker customs. The <i>Two Gentlewomen</i> were
once Friends; but one of them having become the
widow of a fast young Englishman, they both
take up the ways of the mother country. A
courtly old colonel courts them both with rare impartiality.
<i>Our Little Neighbors</i> is a sympathetic
picture of childhood, with a quaintly humorous
ending. Even more humorous is <i>Pamelia Tewksbury's
Courtship</i>, laid in central New York.
Mrs. Gardner's treatment of this episode, though
it recalls Miss Wilkins, can well bear the comparison.
Next come the <i>Ante-Bellum Letters</i>,
which occupy about a third of the book and make
an excellent foil to the more demure tales which
they interrupt like a sort of vigorous interlude.
The Quakeress who writes them is suddenly
plunged into the comparative dissipations of Boston,
into the lively society of Harvard undergraduates,
and into gay raiment that distresses
her; but this lively intermezzo ends with a graver
strain. The figures of the great Abolitionists are
faintly seen, and at the trial of a poor negro boy,
who is demanded as a fugitive slave, Lucretia
Mott appears and sits by the prisoner, cheering
him through the long night session of the court.
The frontispiece represents this scene. The book
closes with a quaint old story, way back in 1815,
in which a romantic French boy, escaped from jail,
and a Quakeress, more beautiful than her parents
care to have her, figure prominently. There is a
deep note of pathos in this tale, and the good influence
of the Quakers in prison reform is shown,
as their brave work for abolition has been in the
<i>Ante-Bellum Letters</i>. Here and there a few lines
give remarkable nature-pictures, as in the following:</p>
